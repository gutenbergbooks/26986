<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p>It was a warm, grey, moist evening, typical Irish
weather, and Miss Berknowles was curled up in
a window-seat of the library reading a book. Kilgobbin
Park lay outside with the rooks cawing in the
trees, miles of park land across which the dusk was
coming, blotting out all things from Arranakilty to
the Slieve Bloom Mountains.</p>
<p>The turf fire burning on the great hearth threw
out a rich steady glow that touched the black oak
panelling of the room, the book backs, and the long-nosed
face of Sir Nicholas Berknowles &#8220;attributed
to Lely&#8221; and looking down at his last descendant
from a dusty canvas on the opposite wall.</p>
<p>The girl made a prettier picture. Red hair when
it is of the right colour is lovely, and Phylice Berknowles&#8217;
hair was of the right red, worn in a tail&mdash;she
was only fifteen&mdash;so long that she could bite the
end with ease and comfort when she was in a meditative
mood, a habit of perdition that no schoolmistress
could break her of.</p>
<p>She was biting her tail now as she read, up to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
eyes in the marvellous story of the Gold Bug, and
now, unable to read any more by the light from the
window, she came to the fire, curled herself on the
hearthrug and continued the adventures of the treasure-seekers
by the light of the burning turf.</p>
<p>What a pretty face it was, seen by the full warm
glow of the turf, and what a perfectly shaped head!
It was not the face and head of a Berknowles as
you could easily have perceived had you compared
it with the portraits in the picture gallery, but of a
Mascarene.</p>
<p>Phyl&#8217;s mother had been a Mascarene, a member of
the old, adventurous family that settled in Virginia
when Virginia was a wilderness and spread its
branches through the Carolinas when the Planter
was king of the South. Red hair had run among
the Mascarenes, red hair and a wild spirit that
brooked no contradiction and knew no fear. Phyl
had inherited something of this restless and daring
spirit. She had run away from the Rottingdean
Academy for the Daughters of the Nobility and
Gentry where she had been sent at the age of twelve;
making her way back to Ireland like a homing pigeon,
she had turned up one morning at breakfast time,
quite unshaken by her experiences of travel and with
the announcement that she did not like school.</p>
<p>Had her mother been alive the traveller would
have been promptly returned, but Phyl&#8217;s father,
good, easy man, was too much taken up with agrarian
disputes, hunting, and the affairs of country
life to bother much about the small affair of his
daughter&#8217;s future and education. He accepted her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
rejection of his plans, wrote a letter of apology to
the Rottingdean Academy, and hired a governess
for her. She wore out three in eighteen months, declared
herself dissatisfied with governesses and competent
to finish the process of educating and polishing
herself.</p>
<p>This she did with the aid of all the books in the
library, old Dunn, the rat-catcher of Arranakilty, a
man profoundly versed in the habits of rodents and
birds, Larry the groom, and sundry others of low
estate but high intelligence in matters of sport and
woodcraft.</p>
<p>Now it might be imagined from the foregoing
that hardihood, self-assertion, and other unpleasant
characteristics would be indicated in the manner and
personality of this lover of freedom and rebel
against restraint. Not at all. She was a most
lovable and clinging person, when she could get hold
of anything worth clinging to, with a mellifluous
Irish voice at once soothing and distracting, a voice
with pockets in it but not a trace of a brogue or
only the very faintest suspicion. Yet when she
spoke she had the Irish turn of words and she used
the word &#8220;sure&#8221; in a manner strange to the English.</p>
<p>She had reached the point in the &#8220;Gold Bug&#8221;
where Jupp is threatening to beat Legrand, when,
laying the book down beside her on the hearthrug,
she sat with her hands clasping her knees and her
eyes fixed on the fire.</p>
<p>The tale had suddenly lost interest. She was
thinking of her dead father, the big, hearty man
who had gone to America only eight weeks ago and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
who would never return. He had gone on a visit
to some of his wife&#8217;s people, fallen ill, and died.</p>
<p>Phyl could not understand it at all. She had
cried her heart out amongst the ruins of her little
world, but she could not understand why it had been
ruined, or what her father had done to be killed like
that, or what she had done to deserve such misery.
The Reverend Peter Graham of Arranakilty could
explain nothing about the matter to her understanding.
She nearly died and then miraculously recovered.
Acute grief often ends like that, suddenly.
The mourner may be maimed for life but the sharpness
of the pain of that dreadful, dreadful disease is
gone.</p>
<p>Phyl found herself one morning discussing rats
with old Dunn, asking him how many he had caught
in the barn and taking a vague sort of interest in
what the old fellow was saying; books began to appeal
to her again and the old life to run anew in a
crippled sort of way. Then other things happened.
Mr. Hennessey, the family lawyer, who had been a
crony of her father&#8217;s and who had known her from
infancy, came down to Kilgobbin to arrange matters.</p>
<p>It seemed that Mr. Berknowles before dying had
made a will and that the will was being brought over
from the States by Mr. Pinckney, his wife&#8217;s cousin
in whose house he had died.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know what the chap wants coming
over with it for,&#8221; said Mr. Hennessey. &#8220;He
said it was by your father&#8217;s request he was coming,
but it&#8217;s a long journey for a man to take at this
season of the year&mdash;and I hope the will is all right.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>There was an implied distrust in his tone and an
antagonism to Mr. Pinckney that was not without
its effect on Phyl.</p>
<p>She disliked Mr. Pinckney. She had never seen
him but she disliked him all the same, and she feared
him. She felt instinctively that this man was coming
to make some alteration in her way of life. She
did not want any change, she wanted to go on living
just as she was with Mrs. Driscoll the housekeeper
to look after her and all the old servants to befriend
her and Mr. Hennessey to pay the bills.</p>
<p>Mr. Hennessey was in the house now. He had
come down that morning from Dublin to receive Mr.
Pinckney, who was due to arrive that night.</p>
<p>Phyl, sitting on the hearthrug, was in the act of
picking up her book when the door opened and in
came Mr. Hennessey.</p>
<p>He had been out in the grounds overlooking
things and he came to the fire to warm his hands,
telling Phyl to sit easy and not disturb herself.
Then, as he held a big foot to the warmth he talked
down at the girl, telling her of what he had been
about and the ruination Rafferty was letting the
greenhouses go to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Half-a-dozen panes of glass out&mdash;and &#8216;I&#8217;ve no
putty,&#8217; says he. &#8216;Putty,&#8217; said I to him, &#8216;and what&#8217;s
that head of yours made of?&#8217; The stoves are all
out of order and there&#8217;s a hole in one of the flues
I could get my thumb in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rafferty&#8217;s awfully good to the dogs,&#8221; said Phyl
in her mellow voice, so well adapted for intercession.
&#8220;He may be a bit careless, but he never does forget
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
to feed the animals. He&#8217;s got the chickens to look
after, too, and then there&#8217;s the beagles, he knows
every dog in the pack and every dog knows him&mdash;oh,
dear, what&#8217;s the good of it all!&#8221;</p>
<p>The thought of the beagles had brought up the
vision of their master who would never hunt with
them again. Her voice became tinged with melancholy
and Hennessey changed the subject, taking his
seat in one of the armchairs that stood on either
side of the fireplace.</p>
<p>He was a big, loosely-made man, an easy going
man with a kind heart who would have come to financial
disaster long ago only for his partner, Niven.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s almost due to be here by now,&#8221; said he,
taking out his watch and looking at it, &#8220;unless the
express from Dublin is late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll he be like, do you think?&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no saying,&#8221; replied Mr. Hennessey.
&#8220;He&#8217;s an American and I&#8217;ve never had much dealings
with Americans except by letter. By all accounts
they are sharp business men, but I daresay
he is all right. The thing that gets me is his coming
over. Americans don&#8217;t go thousands of miles for
nothing, but if it&#8217;s after any hanky-panky business
about the property, maybe he&#8217;ll find Jack Hennessey
as sharp as any American.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s some sort of a relation of ours,&#8221; said Phyl.
&#8220;Father said he was a sort of cousin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On your mother&#8217;s side,&#8221; said Hennessey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Phyl. Then, after a moment&#8217;s pause,
&#8220;D&#8217;you know I&#8217;ve often thought of all those people
over there and wondered what they were like and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
how they lived&mdash;my mother&#8217;s people. Father used
to talk of them sometimes. He said they kept
slaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was in the old days,&#8221; said Hennessey.
&#8220;The slaves are all gone long ago. They used to
have sugar plantations and suchlike, but the war
stopped all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny,&#8221; said Phyl, &#8220;to think that my people
kept slaves&mdash;my mother&#8217;s people&mdash;Oh, if one could
only see back, see all the people that have gone before
one so long ago&mdash; Don&#8217;t you ever feel like
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hennessey never had; his forebears had been
liquor dealers in Athlone and he was content to let
them lie without a too close inquisition into the romances
of their lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hennessey,&#8221; said Phyl, after a moment&#8217;s
silence, &#8220;suppose Father has left Mr. Pinckney all
his money&mdash;what will become of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord only knows,&#8221; said Hennessey; &#8220;but
what&#8217;s been putting such fancies in your head?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied the girl. &#8220;I was just
thinking. Of course he wouldn&#8217;t do such a thing&mdash;It&#8217;s
your talking of the will the last time you were
here set me on, I suppose, but I dreamed last night
Mr. Pinckney came and he was an American with
a beard like Uncle Sam in <i>Punch</i> last week, and he
said Father had made a will and left him everything&mdash;he&#8217;d
left him me as well as everything else, and the
dogs and all the servants and Kilgobbin&mdash;then I
woke up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you were dreaming nonsense,&#8221; said the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
practical Hennessey. &#8220;A man can&#8217;t leave his daughter
away from him, though I&#8217;m half thinking there&#8217;s
many a man would be willing enough if he could.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl raised her head. Her quick ear had caught
a sound from the avenue. Then the crash of wheels
on gravel came from outside and her companion,
rising hurriedly from his chair, went to the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s him,&#8221; said the easy-speaking Hennessey.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p>He left the room and Phyl, rising from the
hearthrug, stood with her hand on the mantelpiece
listening.</p>
<p>Hennessey had left the door open and she could
hear a confused noise from the hall, the sound of
luggage being brought in, the bustle of servants and
a murmur of voices.</p>
<p>Then a voice that made her start.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, I can carry it myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the newcomer&#8217;s voice, he was being conducted
to his room by Hennessey. It was a cheerful,
youthful voice, not in the least suggestive of Uncle
Sam with the goatee beard as depicted by the unimaginative
artist of <i>Punch</i>. And it was a voice she
had heard before, so she fancied, but where, she
could not possibly tell&mdash;nor did she bother to think,
dismissing the idea as a fancy.</p>
<p>She stood listening, but heard nothing more, only
the wind that had risen and was shaking the ivy
outside the windows.</p>
<p>Byrne, the old manservant, came in and lit the
lamps and then after a few minutes Hennessey entered.
He looked cheerful.</p>
<p>&#8220;He seems all right and he&#8217;ll be down in a minute,&#8221;
said the lawyer; &#8220;not a bit of harm in him,
though I haven&#8217;t had time to tackle him over money
affairs.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How old is he?&#8221; asked the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old! Why, he&#8217;s only a boy, but he&#8217;s got all a
man&#8217;s ways with him&mdash;he&#8217;s American, they&#8217;re like
that. I&#8217;ve heard say the American children order
their own mothers and fathers about and drive their
own motor-cars and gamble on the Stock Exchange.&#8221;
He pulled out his watch and looked at it; it pointed
to ten minutes past seven; then he lit a cigar and sat
smoking and smoking without a word whilst Phyl
sat thinking and staring at the fire. They were
seated like this when the door opened and Byrne
shewed in Mr. Pinckney.</p>
<p>Hennessey had called him a boy. He was not
that. He was twenty-two years of age, yet he looked
only twenty and you would not have been particularly
surprised if you had been told that he was only
nineteen. Good-looking, well-groomed and well-dressed,
he made a pleasant picture, and as he came
across the room to greet Phyl he explained without
speaking what Mr. Hennessey meant about &#8220;all the
manners of a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinckney&#8217;s manner was the manner of a man of
the world of thirty, easy-going, assured, and decided.</p>
<p>He shook hands with Phyl as Hennessey introduced
them, and then stood with his back to the
fireplace talking, as she took her seat in the armchair
on the right, whilst the lawyer remained standing,
hands in pockets and foot on the left corner of the
fender.</p>
<p>The newcomer did most of the talking. By a
downward glance every now and then he included
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
Phyl in the conversation, but he addressed most of
his remarks to Mr. Hennessey.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you came over by the Holyhead route?&#8221;
said the lawyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; replied Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what did you think of Kingstown?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, upon my word, I saw less of it than of a
gentleman with long hair and a bundle of newspapers
under his arm who received me like a mother just as
I landed, hypnotised me into buying half-a-dozen
newspapers and started me off for Dublin with his
blessing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was Davy Stevens,&#8221; said Phyl, speaking
for the first time.</p>
<p>Pinckney&#8217;s entrance had produced upon her the
same effect as his voice.</p>
<p>You know the feeling that some places produce on
the mind when first seen&mdash;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;I have been here before</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>But when or how I cannot tell</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>I know the lights along the shore&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>It seemed to her that she had known Pinckney
and had met him in some place, but when or how
she could not possibly remember. The feeling had
almost worn off now. It had thrilled her, but the
thrill had vanished and the concrete personality of
the man was dominating her mind&mdash;and not very
pleasantly.</p>
<p>There was nothing in his manner or his words to
give offence; he was quite pleasant and nice but&mdash;but&mdash;well,
it was almost as though she had met some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
one whom she had known and liked and who had
changed.</p>
<p>The little jump of the heart that his voice caused
in her had been followed by a chill. His manner
displeased her vaguely. He seemed so assured, so
every day, so cold.</p>
<p>It seemed to her that not only did he hold his
entertainers at a critical distance, but that he was
somehow wanting in respectfulness to herself&mdash;Lunatic
ideas, for the young man could not possibly
have been more cordial towards two utter strangers
and as for respectfulness, one does not treat a girl
in a pigtail exactly as one treats a full-grown woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Davy Stevens, was it?&#8221; said Pinckney, glancing
down at Phyl. &#8220;Well, I never knew the meaning
of peaceful persuasion till he had sold out his
stock on me. Now in the States that man would
likely have been President by this&mdash;Things grow
quicker over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what did you think of Dublin?&#8221; asked Hennessey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the young man, &#8220;the two things that
struck me most about Dublin were the dirt and the
want of taxicabs.&#8221;</p>
<p>A dead silence followed this remark.</p>
<p>Never tell an Irishman that Dublin is dirty.</p>
<p>Hennessey was dumb, and as for Phyl, she knew
now that she hated this man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; went on the other, &#8220;it&#8217;s a fine old
city and I&#8217;m not sure that I would alter it or even
brush it up. I should think it&#8217;s pretty much the
same to-day as when Lever wrote of it. It&#8217;s a survival
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
of the past, like Nuremberg. All the same,
one doesn&#8217;t want to live in a survival of the past&mdash;does
one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lived there a good many years,&#8221; said Hennessey;
&#8220;and I&#8217;ve managed to survive it. It&#8217;s not
Chicago, of course; it&#8217;s just Dublin, and it doesn&#8217;t
pretend to be anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said Pinckney. He felt that he had
put his foot in it; recalling his own lightly spoken
words he felt shocked at his want of tact, and he
was casting about for something to say about the
sacred city of a friendly nature but not too fulsome,
when Byrne opened the door and announced that
dinner was served.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p>Phyl led the way and they crossed the hall to
the dining-room, a room oak-panelled like the
library and warm with the light of fire and candles.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there had been high doings in
this sombre room, hunt breakfasts and dinners, rousing
songs, laughter, and the toasting of pretty women&mdash;now
dust and ashes.</p>
<p>Here highly coloured gentlemen had slept the
sleep of the just, under the table, whilst the ladies
waited in vain for them in the drawing-room, here
Colonel Berknowles had drunk a glass of mulled
wine on that black morning over a hundred-and-thirty
years ago when he went out with Councillor
Kinsella and shot him through the lungs by the
Round House on the Arranakilty Road. The diminutive
Tom Moore had sung his songs here &#8220;put
standing on the table&#8221; by the other guests, and the
great Dan had held forth and the wind had dashed
the ivy against the windows just as it did to-night
with fist-fulls of rain from the Slieve Bloom Mountains.
Byrne had put the big silver candlesticks on
the table in honour of the guest, and he now appeared
bearing in front of him a huge dish with a cover a
size too small for it.</p>
<p>He placed the dish before Mr. Hennessey and removed
the cover, disclosing a cod&#8217;s &#8220;head and shoulders&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
whilst a female servant appeared with a dish
of potatoes boiled in their jackets and a tureen of
oyster sauce.</p>
<p>Now a cod&#8217;s head and shoulders served up like
this in the good old Irish way is, honestly, a ghastly
sight. The thing has a countenance and an expression
most forbidding and all its own.</p>
<p>The appearance of the old dish cover, clapped on
by the cook in a hurry in default of the proper one,
had given Phyl a turn and now she was wondering
what Mr. Pinckney was thinking of the fish and the
manner of its serving.</p>
<p>All at once and as if stimulated into life by the
presence of the new guest, all sorts of qualms awoke
in her mind. The dining arrangements of the better
class Irish are, and always have been, rather primitive,
haphazard, and lacking in small refinements.
Phyl was conscious of the fact that Byrne had placed
several terrible old knives on the table, knives that
properly belonged to the kitchen, and when the second
course, consisting of a boiled chicken, faced by
a piece of bacon reposing on a mat of boiled cabbage,
appeared, the fact that one of the dishes was
cracked confronted her with the equally obvious fact
that the cook in her large-hearted way had sent up
the chicken with the black legs unremoved.</p>
<p>It seemed to Phyl&#8217;s vision&mdash;now thoroughly distorted&mdash;that
the eyes of the stranger were everywhere,
cool, critical, and amused; so obsessed was
her mind with this idea that it could take no hold
upon the conversation. Pinckney was talking of the
States; he might just as well have been talking about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
Timbuctoo for all the impression he made on her
with her unfortunate head filled with cracked dishes,
chickens&#8217; black legs, Byrne&#8217;s awkwardness and the
suddenly remembered crumb-brush.</p>
<p>It was twenty years old and it had lost half of its
bristles in the service of the Berknowles who had
clung to it with a warm-hearted tenacity purely Irish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, that old brush is a disgrace to the table,&#8221;
was the comment Phyl&#8217;s father had made on it once,
just as though he were casually referring to some
form of the Inevitable such as the state of the
weather.</p>
<p>The disgrace had not been removed and it was
coming to the table, now, in the hand of Byrne.
Phyl watched the crumbs being swept up, she watched
the cloth being taken off and the wine and dessert
placed in the good old fashion, on the polished mahogany,
then leaving the gentlemen to their wine, she
retired upstairs and to her bedroom.</p>
<p>She felt angry with Byrne, with the cook, with
Mr. Hennessey and with herself. Plenty of people
had been to dinner at Kilgobbin, yet she had never
felt ashamed of the <i>ménage</i> till now. This stranger
from over the water, notwithstanding her dislike for
him, had the power to disturb her mind as few other
people had disturbed it in the course of her short life.
Other people had put her into worse tempers, other
people had made her dislike them, but no one else
had ever roused her into this feeling of unrest, this
criticism of her belongings, this irritation against
everything including herself.</p>
<p>Her bedroom was a big room with two windows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
looking upon the park; it was almost in black darkness,
but the windows shewed in dim, grey oblongs
and she made her way to one of them, took her place
in the window-seat and pressed her forehead against
the glass. The rain had ceased and the clouds had
risen, but the moon was not yet high enough to
pierce them. Phyl could just make out the black
masses of the distant woods and the movement of
the near fir-trees shaking their tops like hearse
plumes to the wind.</p>
<p>The park always fascinated her when it was like
that, almost blotted out by night. These shapes in
the dark were akin to shapes in the fire in their power
over the fancy of the gazer. Phyl as she watched
them was thinking: not one word had this stranger
said about her dead father.</p>
<p>Mr. Berknowles had died in his house and this
man had buried him in Charleston; he had come over
here to Ireland on the business of the will and he
had come into the dead man&#8217;s house as unconcernedly
as though it were an hotel, and he had laughed and
talked about all sorts of things with never a word of
Him.</p>
<p>If Phyl had thought over the matter, she might
have seen that, perhaps, this silence of Pinckney&#8217;s
was the silence of delicacy, not of indifference, but
she was not in the humour to hold things up to the
light of reason. She had decided to dislike this man
and when the Mascarenes came to a decision of this
sort they were hard to be shaken from it.</p>
<p>She had decided to dislike him long before she
saw him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>What Phyl really wanted now was perhaps a commonsense
female relative to stiffen her mind against
fancies and give her a clear-sighted view of the
world, but she had none. Philip Berknowles was
the last of his race, the few distant connections he
had in Ireland lived away in the south and were separated
from him by the grand barrier that divides
Ireland into two opposing camps&mdash;Religion. Berknowles
was a Protestant, the others Papists.</p>
<p>Phyl, as she sat watching saw, now, the line of
the woods strengthen against the sky; the moon
was breaking through the clouds and its light increasing
minute by minute shewed the parkland
clearly defined, the leafless oaks standing here and
there, oaks that of a summer afternoon stood in
ponds of shadow, the clumps of hazel, and away to
the west the great dip, a little valley haunted by a
fern-hidden river, a glen mysterious and secretive,
holding in its heart the Druids&#8217; altar.</p>
<p>The Druids&#8217; altar was the pride of Kilgobbin
Park; it consisted of a vast slab of stone supported
on four other stones, no man knew its origin, but
popular imagination had hung it about with all sorts
of gruesome fancies. Victims had been slaughtered
there in the old days, a vein of ironstone in the great
slab had become the bloodstain of men sacrificed by
the Druids; the glen was avoided by day and there
were very few of the country people round about who
would have entered it by night. Phyl, who had no
fear of anything, loved the place; she had known it
from childhood and had been accustomed to take her
worries and bothers there and bury them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>It was a friend, places can become friends and,
sometimes, most terrific enemies.</p>
<p>The girl listening, now, heard voices below stairs.
Hennessey and his companion were evidently leaving
the dining-room and crossing the hall to the
library. Going out on the landing she caught a
glimpse of them as they stood for a moment looking
at the trophies in the hall, then they went into the
library, the door was closed, and Phyl came downstairs.</p>
<p>In the hall she slipped on a pair of goloshes over
her thin shoes, put on a cloak and hat and came
out of the front door, closing it carefully behind her.</p>
<p>To put it in her own words, she couldn&#8217;t stand the
house any longer. Not till this very evening did she
feel the great change that her father&#8217;s death had
brought in her life, not till now did she fully know
that her past was dead as well as her father, and not
till she had left the house did the feeling come to her
that Pinckney was to prove its undertaker.</p>
<p>There was something alike cold and fateful in the
impression that this man had made upon her, an
extraordinary impression, for it would be impossible
to imagine anything further removed from the
ideas of Coldness and Fate than the idea of the
cheerful and practical Pinckney. However, there it
was, her heart was chilled with the thought of him
and the instinctive knowledge that he was going to
make a great alteration in her life.</p>
<p>She crossed the gravelled drive to the grass sward
beyond. The night had altered marvellously; nearly
every vestige of cloud had vanished, blown away by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
the wind. The wind and the moon had the night
between them and the air was balmy as the air of
summer.</p>
<p>Phyl turned and looked back at the house with all
its windows glittering in the moonlight, then she
struck across the grass now almost dried by the wind.</p>
<p>Phyl had something of the night bird in her composition.
She had often been out long before dawn
to pick up night lines in the river and she knew the
woods by dark as well as by day. She was out now
for nothing but a breath of fresh air, she did not
intend to stay more than ten minutes, and she was
on the point of returning to the house when a cry
from the woods made her pause.</p>
<p>One might have fancied that some human being
was crying out in agony, but Phyl knew that it was
a fox, a fox caught in a trap. She was confirmed
in her knowledge by the barking of its mates; they
would be gathered round the trapped one lending all
the help they could&mdash;with their voices.</p>
<p>The girl did not pause to think; forgetting that
she had no weapon with which to put the poor beast
out of its misery, and no means of freeing it without
being bitten, she started off at a run in the direction
of the sound, entering the woods by a path that led
through a grove of hazel; leaving this path she struck
westward swift as an Indian along the road of the
call.</p>
<p>Her mother&#8217;s people had been used to the wilds,
and Phyl had more than a few drops of tracker blood
in her veins; better than that, she had a trace of the
wood instinct that leads a man about the forest and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
makes him able to strike a true line to the west or
east or north or south without a compass.</p>
<p>The trees were set rather sparsely here and the
moonlight shewed vistas of withered fern. The
wind had fallen, and in the vast silence of the night
this place seemed unreal as a dream. The fox had
evidently succeeded in liberating itself from the trap,
for its cries had ceased, cut off all of a sudden as
though by a closing door.</p>
<p>Phyl paused to listen and look around her.
Through all the night from here, from there, came
thin traces of sound, threads fretting the silence.
The trotting of a horse a mile away on the Arranakilty
road, the bark of a dog from near the Round
House, the shaky bleat of a sheep from the fold at
Ross&#8217; farm came distinct yet diminished almost to
vanishing point. It was like listening to the country
sounds of Lilliput. With these came the vaguest
whisper of flowing water, broken now and again by
a little shudder of wind in the leafless branches of
the trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s out,&#8221; said Phyl to herself. She was thinking
of the fox. She knew that the trap must be
somewhere about and she guessed who had set it.
Rafferty, without a doubt, for only the other day he
had been complaining of the foxes having raided the
chickens, but there was no use in hunting for the
thing by this light and without any indication of its
exact whereabouts, so she struck on, determined to
return to the house by the more open ground leading
through the Druids&#8217; glen.</p>
<p>She had been here before in the very early morning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
before sunrise on her way to the river, Rafferty following
her with the fish creel, but she had never seen
the place like this with the moonlight on it and she
paused for a moment to rest and think, taking her
seat on a piece of rock by the cromlech.</p>
<p>Phyl, despite her American strain, was very Irish
in one particular: though cheerful and healthy and
without a trace of morbidness in her composition,
she, still, was given to fits of melancholy&mdash;not depression,
melancholy. It is in the air of Ireland,
the moist warm air that feeds the shamrock and fills
the glens with soft-throated echoes and it is in the
soul of the people.</p>
<p>Phyl, seated in this favourite spot of hers, where
she had played as a child on many a warm summer&#8217;s
afternoon, gave herself over to the moonlight and
the spirit of Recollection.</p>
<p>She had forgotten Pinckney, and the strange disturbance
that he had occasioned in her mind had
sunk to rest; she was thinking of her father, of all
the pleasant days that were no more&mdash;she remembered
her dolls, the wax ones with staring eyes,
dummies and effigies compared with that mysterious,
soulful, sinful, frightful, old rag doll with the inked
face, true friend in affliction and companion in joy,
and even more, a Ju-ju to be propitiated. That
thing had stirred in her a sort of religious sentiment,
had caused in her a thrill of worship real, though
faint, far more real than the worship of God that
had been cultivated in her mind by her teachers.
The old Druid stone had affected her child&#8217;s mind in
somewhat the same way, but with a difference. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
Ju-ju was a familiar, she had even beaten and
punched it when in a temper; the stone had always
filled her with respect.</p>
<p>There are some people the doors of whose minds
are absolutely closed on the past; we call them material
and practical people; there are others in which
the doors of division are a wee crack open, or even
ajar, so that their lives are more or less haunted
by whisperings from that strange land we call yesterday.</p>
<p>In some of the Burmese and Japanese children
the doors stand wide open so that they can see themselves
as they were before they passed through the
change called death, but the Westerners are denied
this. In Phyl&#8217;s mind as a child one might suppose
that through the doors ajar some recollections of
forgotten gods once worshipped had stolen, and
that the power of the Ju-ju and the Druids&#8217; stone
lay in their power of focussing those vague and wandering
threads of remembrance.</p>
<p>To-night this power seemed regained, for she
passed from the contemplation of concrete images
into a vague and pleasant state, an absolute idleness
of the intellect akin to that which people call daydreaming.</p>
<p>With her cloak wrapped round her she sat, elbows
on knees and her chin in the palms of her hands
giving herself up to Nothing before starting to resume
her way to the house.</p>
<p>Sitting like this she suddenly started and turned.
Some one had called her:</p>
<p>&#8220;Phylice!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>For a moment she fancied that it was a real voice,
and then she knew that it was only a voice in her
head, one of those sounds we hear when we are half
asleep, one of those hails from dreamland that come
now as the ringing of a bell that never has rung, or
the call of a person who has never spoken.</p>
<p>She rose up and resumed her way, striking along
the glen to the open park, yet still the memory of
that call pursued her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phylice!&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed Mr. Pinckney&#8217;s voice, it <i>was</i> his voice,
she was sure of that now, and she amused herself
by wondering why his voice had suddenly popped up
in her head. She had been thinking about him more
than about any one else that evening and that easily
accounted for the matter. Fancy had mimicked him&mdash;yet
why did Fancy use her name and clothe it in
Pinckney&#8217;s voice?&mdash;and it was distinctly a call, the
call of a person who wishes to draw another person&#8217;s
attention.</p>
<p>Pinckney had never called her by her name and
she felt almost irritated at the impertinence of the
phantom voice in doing so.</p>
<p>This same irritation made her laugh when she
realised it. Then the idea that Byrne might lock
the hall door before she could get back drove every
other thought away and she began to run, her
shadow running before her over the moonlit grass.</p>
<p>Half way across the sward, which was divided
from the grass land proper by a Ha-ha, she heard
the stable clock striking eleven.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p>When Phyl withdrew from the dining-room,
Hennessey filled his glass with port, Pinckney,
who took no wine, lit a cigarette and the two
men drew miles closer to one another in conversation.</p>
<p>They were both relieved by the withdrawal of
the girl, Hennessey because he wanted to talk business,
Pinckney because her presence had affected
him like a wet blanket.</p>
<p>His first impression of Phyl had been delightful,
then, little by little, her stiffness and seeming lifelessness
had communicated themselves to him. It
seemed to him that he had never met a duller or
more awkward schoolgirl. His mind was of that
quick order which requires to be caught in the uptake
rapidly in order to shine. Slowness, coldness,
dulness or hesitancy in others depressed him just as
dull weather depressed him. He did not at all know
with what a burning interest his arrival had been
awaited, or the effect that his voice had produced
and his first appearance. He did not know how the
dull schoolgirl had weighed him in a mysterious balance
which she herself did not quite comprehend and
had found him slightly wanting. Neither could he
tell the extent of the paralyses produced in that same
mind of hers by the cracked china, the old dish cover,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
Byrne&#8217;s awkwardness, and the deboshed crumb-brush.</p>
<p>He should have kept to his first impression of her,
for first impressions are nearly always right; he
should have sought for the reason of so much charm
proving charmless, so much positive attraction proving
so negative in effect. But he did not. He just
took her as he found her and was glad she was gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I believe,&#8221; said Hennessey, &#8220;the South is
different now. It used to be all cotton before the
war.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Pinckney. &#8220;Before the war there
was a lot of cotton grown but we used to grow other
things as well, we used to feed ourselves, the plantation
was economically independent. The war
broke us. We had to get money, so we grew cotton
as cotton was never grown before; the South became
a great sheet of cotton. You see, cotton is the only
crop you can mortgage, so we grew cotton and mortgaged
it. Of course the old-time planter is gone,
everything is done now by companies, and that&#8217;s the
devil of it&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinckney was silent for a moment and sat staring
before him as though he were looking at the Past.</p>
<p>&#8220;Companies, you see, don&#8217;t grow sunflowers to
look at, don&#8217;t grow trees to shade them, don&#8217;t make
love in a wild and extravagant manner and shoot
other companies for crossing them in their affections&mdash;don&#8217;t
play the guitar, in short.</p>
<p>&#8220;Companies don&#8217;t breed trotting horses and wear
panama hats and put flowers in their buttonholes.
The old Planter used to do these things and a lot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
of others. He was a bit of a patriarch in his way,
too&mdash;well, he&#8217;s gone and more&#8217;s the pity. He&#8217;s like
an old house pulled down. No one can ever build
it again as it was. The South&#8217;s a big industrial
region now. Not only cotton&mdash;ore and coal and
machinery. We supply the North and East with
pig-iron, machinery, God knows what. Berknowles
was very keen on Southern industries, regularly bitten.
He was talking of selling off here and coming
to settle in Charleston when the illness took him&mdash;
and that reminds me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took a document from his pocket. &#8220;This is
the will. I&#8217;ve kept it on my person since I started
for here. It&#8217;s not the thing to trust to a handbag.
It&#8217;s in correct form, I believe. Temperley, our solicitor,
made it out for him and it leaves everything
to the girl when she&#8217;s twenty&mdash;but just read it and
see what you think.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lit another cigarette whilst Hennessey, putting
on his glasses and pushing his dessert plate away,
spread the will on the table.</p>
<p>Pinckney watched him as he read it. Hennessey
was a new order of being to him. This easy-going,
slipshod, garrulous gentleman, fond of his glass of
wine, contrasted strangely with the typical lawyer
of the States. Flushed and not in his business mood,
the man of law cast his eyes over the document before
him, reading bits of it here and there and seeming
not inclined to bother himself by a concentration
of his full energies on the matter.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, his eyes became fixed on a paragraph
which he re-read as though puzzled by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
meaning of it. Then he looked up at the other over
his glasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s this?&#8221; said he. &#8220;He has made
<i>you</i> Phyl&#8217;s guardian. <i>You!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinckney laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that was the chief thing that brought me
over. He has made me her guardian, till she&#8217;s
twenty, and he made me promise to look after her
interests and see to all business arrangements. He
said he had no near relations in Ireland, and he said
that he&#8217;d sooner trust the devil than the few relatives
he had, that they were Papists&mdash;that is to say
Roman Catholics&mdash;he seemed to fear them like the
deuce and their influence on the girl. I couldn&#8217;t understand
him. I&#8217;ve never seen any harm in Roman
Catholics; there are loads in the States and they
seem to be just as good citizens as the others, better,
for they seem to stick tighter by their religion. Anyhow,
there you are. Berknowles had them on the
brain and nothing would do him but I must come
over to look after the business myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hennessey, with his finger on the will, had been
staring at Pinckney during this. He looked down
now at the document and then up again.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&mdash;her guardian&mdash;why, it&#8217;s absurd,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;You aren&#8217;t old enough to be a guardian, why,
Lord bless my soul, what&#8217;ll people be doing next?
A young chap like you to be the guardian of a girl
like Phyl&mdash;why, it&#8217;s not proper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only am I to be her guardian,&#8221; said Pinckney
with a twinkle in his eyes, &#8220;but she&#8217;s to come and
live under my roof at Charleston. I promised Berknowles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
that&mdash;He was dying, you see, and one
can refuse nothing to a dying man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hennessey rose up in an abstracted sort of way,
went to the sideboard, poured himself out a whisky
and soda, took a sip, and sat down again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Extraordinary, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Pinckney, tapping
the ash off his cigarette. &#8220;All the same, you need
not be worried at the impropriety of the business;
there&#8217;s none, nothing improper could live in the same
house with my aunt, Maria Pinckney. Vernons belongs
to her though I live there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vernons,&#8221; put in the other. &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the name of our house in Charleston. It&#8217;s
mine, really, but my father left it to Maria to live
in; it comes to me at her death. I don&#8217;t want that
house at all. I want her to keep it forever, but
it&#8217;s such a pleasant old place, I like to live there instead
of buying a house of my own. Vernons isn&#8217;t
exactly a house, it&#8217;s more like a family tree&mdash;hollow&mdash;with
all the ancestors inside instead of hanging
on the branches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why on earth didn&#8217;t Berknowles make your
aunt guardian to the girl?&#8221; asked Hennessey.
&#8220;There&#8217;d have been some sense in that&mdash;a middle-aged
woman&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said Pinckney, &#8220;my aunt is
not a middle-aged woman, she&#8217;s not fifteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not what?&#8221; said Hennessey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not fifteen&mdash;in years of discretion, though she&#8217;s
over seventy as time goes. She has no knowledge
at all of what money is or what money means&mdash;she
flings it away, doesn&#8217;t spend it&mdash;just flings it away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
on anything and everything but herself. I don&#8217;t believe
there&#8217;s a charity in the States that hasn&#8217;t
squeezed her, or a beggar-man in the South that
hasn&#8217;t banked on her. She was sent into the world
to grow flowers and look after stray dogs and be
robbed by hoboes; she has been nearly seventy years
at it and she doesn&#8217;t know she has ever been robbed.
She&#8217;s not a fool by any manner of means, and she
rules the servants at Vernons in the good old patriarchal
way, but she&#8217;s lost where money is concerned.
That&#8217;s why Berknowles wanted me to look after the
girl&#8217;s interests. As for anything else, I guess Maria
Pinckney will be the real guardian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Hennessey. He was
confused by all these new ideas shot into his mind
suddenly like this after dinner, he could see that
Pinckney was genuine enough, all the same it irritated
him to think that Philip Berknowles should
have chosen a youth like this to be second father to
Phyl. What was the matter with himself, Hennessey?
Hadn&#8217;t he a fine house in Merrion Square
and a wife who would have treated the girl like a
daughter?</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It&#8217;s not for me
to dispute the wishes of a client, but I&#8217;ve known
Phyl since she was born and I&#8217;ve known her father
since we were together at Trinity College and I&#8217;d
have taken it more handsome if he&#8217;d left the looking
after of her to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder he didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Pinckney. &#8220;He spoke
of you a good deal to me, spoke of you as his best
friend; all the same he seemed set on the idea of us
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
taking care of the girl. He fell in love with Charleston
and he cottoned to us; then, of course, there were
the family reasons. Phyl&#8217;s mother was a Mascarene;
my mother was her mother&#8217;s first cousin. Vernons
belonged to the Mascarenes, my mother brought
it to my father as part of her wedding portion. The
Pinckneys&#8217; old house was lost to us in the smash up
after the war. So, you see, Phyl ought to be as
much at home at Vernons as I am. Funny, isn&#8217;t it,
how things get mixed up and old family houses
change hands?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when do you want to take her away?&#8221; asked
Hennessey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon my word, I&#8217;ve never thought of that,&#8221; replied
the other. &#8220;I want to see things settled up
here and to go over the accounts with you. Berknowles
said the house had better be let&mdash;I should
think it would be easy to find a good tenant&mdash;then I
want to go to London on business and get back as
quick as possible. She need not come back with me,
it would scarcely give her time to get things ready.
There&#8217;s a Mrs. Van Dusen, a friend of ours who
lives in New York, she&#8217;s coming over in a month or
so and Phyl might come with her as far as New
York. It&#8217;s all plain sailing after that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hennessey, folding up the will and
putting it in his pocket. &#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s all for the
best, but it&#8217;s hard lines for a man to lose his best
friend and see a good old estate like Kilgobbin taken
off to the States&mdash;Oh, you needn&#8217;t tell me, if Phyl
goes out there she&#8217;s done for as far as Ireland is
concerned. Sure, they never come back, the people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
that go there, and if she does come back it&#8217;ll be with
an American husband and he master of Kilgobbin.
I know what America is, it never lets go of the man
or woman it catches hold of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not far wrong there,&#8221; said Pinckney.
&#8220;You see, life is set to a faster pace in America than
over here and once you learn to step that pace you
feel coming back here as if you were living in a
country where people are hobbled. At least that&#8217;s
my experience. Then the air is different. There&#8217;s
somehow a feeling of morning in America that goes
through the whole day&mdash;almost&mdash;here, afternoon
begins somewhere about eleven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hennessey yawned, and the two men, rising from
the table, left the room and crossed the hall to the
library.</p>
<p>Here, after a while, Hennessey bade the other
good night and departed for bed, whilst Pinckney,
leaning back in his armchair, fell into a lazy and
contemplative mood, his eyes wandering from point
to point.</p>
<p>All this business was very new to him. Pinckney
had inherited his father&#8217;s brains as well as his money.
He had discovered that a large fortune requires just
as much care and attention as a large garden and that
a man can extract just as much interest and amusement
and the physical health that comes from both,
out of money-tending as out of flower and vegetable
growing. Knowing all about cotton and nearly
everything about wheat, he managed occasionally to
do a bit of speculative dealing without the least danger
of burning his fingers. Self-reliant and self-assured,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
knowing his road and all its turnings, he
had moved through life up to this with the ease of
a well-oiled and almost frictionless mechanism.</p>
<p>But here was a new thing of which he had never
dreamed. Here was another destiny suddenly
thrust into his charge and another person&#8217;s property
to be conserved and dealt with. Never, never, did
he dream when acceding to Berknowles&#8217; request, of
the troubles, little difficulties and causes of indecision
that were preparing to meet him.</p>
<p>Up till now, one side of his character had been
almost unknown to him. He had been quite unaware
that he possessed a conscience most painfully
sensitive with regard to the interests of others, a
conscience that would prick him and poison his peace
were he to leave even little things undone in the fulfilment
of the trust he had undertaken so lightheartedly.</p>
<p>Possessing a keen eye for men he began to recognise
now why Berknowles had not chosen the easy-going
Hennessey to look after Phyl and her affairs,
and he guessed, just by the little bit he had seen of
Kilgobbin and the servants, the slipshoddedness and
waste going on behind the scenes in the absence of
a master and mistress.</p>
<p>Pinckney loathed waste as he loathed inefficiency
and as he loathed dirt. They were all three brothers
with Drink in his eyes and as he leaned back in
the chair now, his gaze travelling about the room, he
could not but perceive little things that would have
brought exclamations from the soul of a careful
housekeeper. The furniture had been upholstered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
or rather re-upholstered in leather some five years
ago. There is nothing that cries out so much against
neglect as leather, and the chairs and couch in the
library of Kilgobbin, without exactly crying out, still
told their tale. Some of the buttons were gone, and
some of them hung actually by the thread in the last
stage of departure. There was a tiny triangular
rent in the leather of the armchair wherein Phyl had
been sitting and another armchair wanted a castor.
The huge Persian rug that covered the centre of the
floor shewed marks left by cigar and cigarette ash,
and under a Jacobean book-case in the corner were
stuffed all sorts of odds and ends, old paper-backed
novels, a pair of old shoes, a tennis racquet and a
boxing glove&mdash;besides other things.</p>
<p>Pinckney rose up, went to the book-case and placed
his fingers on top of it, then he looked at his fingers
and the bar of dust upon them, brushed his hand
clean and came back to his chair by the fire. He
heard the stable clock striking eleven. The sound
of the wind that had been raging outside all during
dinner time had died away and the sounds of the
house made themselves manifest, the hundred
stealthy accountable and unaccountable little sounds
that night evolves from an old house set in the stillness
of the country. Just as the night jasmine gives
up its perfume to the night, so does an old house its
past in the form of murmurs and crackings and memories
and suggestions. Notwithstanding Dunn&#8217;s attentions
there were rats alive in the cellars and under
the boarding&mdash;and mice; the passages leading to the
kitchen premises made a whispering gallery where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
murderers seemed consulting together if the scullery
window were forgotten and left open&mdash;as it usually
was, and boards in the uneven flooring that had been
preparing for the act for weeks and months would
suddenly &#8220;go off with a bang,&#8221; a noise startling in
the dead of night as the crack of a pistol, and produced,
heaven knows how, but never by daylight.</p>
<p>Even Pinckney, who did not believe in ghosts, became
aware as he sat now by the fire that the old
house was feeling for him to make him creep, feeling
for him with its old disjointed fingers and all the artfulness
of inanimate things.</p>
<p>He was aware that Sir Nicholas Berknowles was
looking down at him with the terrible patient gaze
of a portrait, and he returned the gaze, trying to
imagine what manner of man this might have been
and how he had lived and what he had done in those
old days that were once real sunlit days filled with
people with real voices, hearts, and minds.</p>
<p>A gentle creak as though a light step had pressed
upon the flooring of the hall brought his mind back
to reality and he was rising from his chair to retire
for the night when a sound from outside the window
made him sit down again. It was the sound of a
step on the gravel path, a step stealthy and light, a
real sound and no contraption of the imagination.</p>
<p>The idea of burglars sprang up in his mind, but
was dismissed; that was no burglar&#8217;s footstep&mdash;and
yet! He listened. The sound had ceased and now
came a faint rubbing as of a hand feeling for the
window followed by the sharp rapping of a knuckle
on the glass.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo,&#8221; cried Pinckney, jumping to his feet
and approaching the shuttered window. &#8220;Who&#8217;s
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me,&#8221; said a voice. &#8220;I&#8217;m locked out.
Byrne&#8217;s bolted the front door. Go to the hall door,
will you, please, and let me in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Phyl,&#8221; said Pinckney to himself. &#8220;Good
heavens!&#8221; Then to the other, &#8220;I&#8217;m coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Byrne had left a lamp lighted in the hall and the
guest&#8217;s candlestick waiting for him on the table.
The lamp was sufficient to show him the executive
side of the big front door that had been nearly battered
in in the time of the Fenians and still possessed
the ponderous locks and bars of a past day when
the tenants of Kilgobbin had fought the pikemen of
Arranakilty and Rupert Berknowles had hung seventeen
rebels, no less, on the branches of the big oak
&#8220;be the gates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinckney undid bolt and bar, turned the key in the
great lock and flung the door open, disclosing Phyl
standing in the moonlight. The contrast between
the forbidding and ponderous door and the charming
little figure against which it had stood as a barrier
might have struck him had his mind been less
astonished. As it was he could think of nothing but
the strangeness of the business in hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where on earth have you been?&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out in the woods,&#8221; said Phyl, entering quite
unconcerned and removing her cloak. &#8220;A fox got
trapped in the woods and I went to let it out and
couldn&#8217;t find it, then that old fool Byrne locked the
door; lucky you were up. I saw the light in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
library shining through a crack in the shutters and
knocked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinckney was putting up the bar and sliding the
bolts. He said nothing. Had Phyl been another
girl, he might have laughed and joked over the
matter, but care of Phyl&#8217;s well-being was now part
of his business in life and that consideration just
checked his speech. There was nothing at all wrong
in the affair, and never for a moment did he dream
of making the slightest remonstrance; still, the unwisdom
of a young girl wandering about in the woods
at night after trapped foxes was a patent fact which
disturbed the mind of this guardian unto dumbness.</p>
<p>Phyl, who was as sensitive to impressions as a
radiometer to light, noted the silence of the other
and resented it as she hung up her old hat and cloak.
She knew nothing of the true facts of the case, she
looked on Pinckney as a being almost of her own
age, and that he should dare to express disapproval
of an act of hers not concerning him, even by silence,
was an intolerable insult. She knew that she loathed
him now.&mdash;Prig!</p>
<p>This was the first real meeting of these two and
Fate, with the help of Irish temper and the Pinckney
conscience, was making a fine fiasco of it.</p>
<p>Phyl, having hung up the hat and coat, turned without
a word, marched into the library and finding the
book she had been reading that day, put it under her
arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; said she as she passed him in the
hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; he replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>He watched her disappearing up the stairs, stood
for a moment irresolute, and then went into the
library. He knew he had offended her and he knew
exactly how he had offended her. There are silences
that can be more hurting than speech&mdash;yet what
could he have said? He rummaged in his mind to
find something he might have said and could find
nothing more appropriate than a remark about
the weather and the fineness of the night. Yet a
bald and decrepit remark like that would have been
as bad almost as silence, for it would have ignored
the main point at issue&mdash;the night-wandering of his
ward.</p>
<p>He sat down again for a moment in the armchair
by the fireplace and began to wrestle with the position
in which he found himself. This was a small
business, but if Phyl in the future was to do things
that he did not approve of it would be his plain duty
to remonstrate with her. An odious position for
youth to be placed in. How she would loathe and
hate him!</p>
<p>Pinckney, though a man of the world in many
ways and a good business man, was still at heart a
boy just as young as Phyl; even in years he was very
little older than she, and the boy side of his mind
was in full revolt at the job set before him by fate.</p>
<p>Then he came to a resolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;She can do jolly well what she pleases,&#8221; said he
to himself, &#8220;without my interference. Aunt Maria
can attend to that. My business will be to look after
her property and keep sharks off it. <i>I&#8217;m</i> not going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
to set up in business to tell a girl what she ought or
oughtn&#8217;t to do&mdash;that&#8217;s a woman&#8217;s job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Satisfied with this seeming solution of the difficulty
he went to bed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Phyl, having marched off with the
book under her arm found, when she reached her
room, that she had forgotten a matchbox, and, too
proud to return to the hall for one, went to bed in
the dark.</p>
<p>She lay awake for an hour, her mind obsessed by
thoughts of this man who had suddenly stepped into
her life, and who possessed such a strange power to
disturb her being and fill it with feelings of unrest,
irritation and, strangely enough, a vague attraction.</p>
<p>The attraction one might fancy the iron to feel
for the distant magnet, or the floating stick for the
far-off whirlpool.</p>
<p>Then she fell asleep and dreamed that they were
at dinner and Mr. Hennessey was waiting at table.
Her father was there and, before the dream converted
itself into something equally fatuous she heard
Pinckney&#8217;s voice, also in the dream; he seemed looking
for her in the hall and he was calling to her,
&#8220;Phyl&mdash;Phyl!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p>Next morning came with a burst of sunshine
and a windy, cloudless sky. Pinckney, dressing
with his window open, could see the park
with the rooks wheeling and cawing over the trees,
whilst the warm wind brought into the room all sorts
of winter scents on the very breath of summer.</p>
<p>This rainy land where the snow rarely comes has
all sorts of surprises of climate and character.
Nothing is truly logical in Ireland, not even winter.
That is what makes the place so delightful to some
minds and so perplexing to others.</p>
<p>Hennessey was staying for a day or two to go over
accounts and explain the working of the estate to
Pinckney.</p>
<p>He was in the hall when the latter came down, and
gave him good morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your mistress?&#8221; said Hennessey to old
Byrne, as they took their seats at the breakfast
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, she&#8217;s been out since six,&#8221; said Byrne.
&#8220;She came down threatenin&#8217; to skin Rafferty alive
for layin&#8217; fox thraps in the woods, then she had a bite
of bread and butter and a cup of tea Norah made
for her, and off she went with Rafferty to hunt out
the thraps and take them up. It&#8217;s little she cares
for breakfast.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was the same way myself when I was her age,&#8221;
said Hennessey to Pinckney. &#8220;Up at four in the
morning and out fishing in Dublin Bay&mdash;it&#8217;s well to
be young.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said the young man, as Byrne left
the room, &#8220;she was out till eleven last night in the
woods; she knocked me up as I was sitting in the
library and I let her in. <i>I</i> don&#8217;t see anything
wrong in the business, but all the same, it&#8217;s
not a particularly safe proceeding and I suppose a
mother or father would have jawed her&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t.
I suppose I showed by my manner that I didn&#8217;t approve
of her being out so late, for she seemed in a
huff as she went up to bed. My position is a bit
difficult, but I&#8217;m hanged if I&#8217;m going to do the heavy
father or careful mother business. If she was only
a boy, I could talk to her like a Dutch uncle, but I
don&#8217;t know anything about girls. I wish&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinckney&#8217;s wish remained forever unexpressed,
for at the moment the door opened and in came
Phyl.</p>
<p>Her face was glowing with the morning air and
she seemed to have forgotten the business of the
night before as she greeted Pinckney and the lawyer
and took her place at the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phyl,&#8221; said the lawyer, half jocularly, &#8220;here&#8217;s
Mr. Pinckney been complaining that you were wandering
about all night in the woods, knocking him
up to let you in at two o&#8217;clock in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl, who was helping herself to bacon, looked
up at Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you cad,&#8221; said her eyes. Then she spoke:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I came in at eleven. If I had known, I would
have called up Byrne or one of the servants to let
me in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinckney could have slain Hennessey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious,&#8221; he said. &#8220;<i>I</i> wasn&#8217;t complaining.
I only just mentioned the fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that I was out till two,&#8221; said Phyl, with
another upward glance of scorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never said any such thing. I said eleven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was my loose way of speaking; but, sure,
what&#8217;s the good of getting out of temper?&#8221; put in
Hennessey. &#8220;Mr. Pinckney wasn&#8217;t meaning anything,
but you see, Phyl, it&#8217;s just this way, your father
has made him your guardian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My <i>what!</i>&#8221; cried the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Oh</i>, Lord!&#8221; said Pinckney, in despair at the
blundering way of the other. Then finding himself
again and the saving vein of humour, without which
man is just a leaden figure:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m your guardian. You must
on no account go out without my permission, or
cough or sneeze without a written permit&mdash;Oh, Phyl,
don&#8217;t be thinking nonsense of that sort. I <i>am</i> your
guardian, it seems, and by your father&#8217;s special request,
but you are absolutely free to do as you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A nice sort of guardian,&#8221; put in Hennessey with
a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am only, really, guardian of your money and
your interests,&#8221; went on the other, &#8220;and your welfare.
When you came in last night late, I was a bit
taken aback and I thought&mdash;as a matter of fact, I
thought it might be dangerous being out alone in this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
wild part of the country so late at night, but I did
not want to interfere; you can understand, can&#8217;t you?
What I want you to get out of your mind is, that I
am that odious thing, a meddling person. I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl was very white. She had risen from the
table and was at the window.</p>
<p>Here was her dream come true of the bearded
American who had suddenly appeared to claim her
and Kilgobbin and the servants and everything.</p>
<p>Pinckney had not a beard, but he was an American
and he had come to claim everything. The word
guardian carried such a force and weight and was
so filled with fantastic possibilities to the mind of
Phyl, that she scarcely heard his soft words and
excuses.</p>
<p>Phyl had the Irish trick of running away with
ideas and embroidering the most palpable truths
with fancies. It was an inheritance from her father,
and she stood by the window now unable to speak,
with the word &#8220;Guardian&#8221; ringing in her ears and
the idea pressing on her mind like an incubus.</p>
<p>Hennessey had risen up. He was the first to
break silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use in meeting troubles half way,&#8221;
said he vaguely. &#8220;You and Phyl will get along all
right when you know each other better. Come out,
the two of you, and we&#8217;ll go round the grounds and
you will be able to see for yourself the state of the
house and what repairs are wanting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; said Pinckney. &#8220;I want to tell
Phyl something&mdash;I&#8217;m going to call you Phyl because
I&#8217;m your guardian&mdash;d&#8217;you mind?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Phyl, &#8220;you can call me anything you
like, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to call you anything I like&mdash;just
Phyl&mdash; Well, then, I want to tell you what we
have to do. It&#8217;s not my wishes I have to carry out
but your father&#8217;s. He wanted to let this house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let Kilgobbin!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is what he said. He wanted to let it
to a good tenant who would look after it till you are
of age. I think he was right. You see, you could
not live here all alone, and if the place was shut up
it would deteriorate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would go to wrack and ruin,&#8221; said Hennessey.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the servants?&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will look after them,&#8221; said Pinckney, &#8220;the
new tenant might take them on; if not, we&#8217;ll give
them time to get new places.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Byrne&#8217;s been here before I was born,&#8221; said the
girl, with dry lips, &#8220;so has Mrs. Driscoll. They
are part of the place; it would ruin their lives to
send them away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Pinckney, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be the
ogre to ruin their lives; you can do anything you
like about them. If the new tenant didn&#8217;t take
them, you might pension them. I want you to be
perfectly happy in your mind and I want you to feel
that though I am, so to speak, the guardian of your
money, still, that money is yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was beginning to understand now that not only
was he striving to soothe her feelings and propitiate
her, but that he was very much in earnest in this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
business, and crowding through her mind came a
great wave of revulsion against herself.</p>
<p>Phyl&#8217;s nature was such that whilst always ready
to fly into wrath and easily moved to bitter resentment,
one touch of kindness, one soft word, had the
power to disarm her.</p>
<p>One soft word from an antagonist had the power
to wound her far more than a dozen words of bitterness.</p>
<p>Filled now with absolutely superfluous self-reproach,
she stood for a moment unable to speak.
Then she said, raising her eyes to his:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure you mean to do what is for the best.&mdash;It
was stupid of me&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit,&#8221; said the other, cheerfully. &#8220;I want
to do the things that will make you happy&mdash;that&#8217;s
all. I&#8217;m a business man and I know the value of
money. Money is just worth the amount of happiness
it brings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, that&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Hennessey, who had
taken his seat again and was in the act of lighting a
cigar.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was a boy,&#8221; went on the other. &#8220;I was
always kept hard up by my father. It was like
pulling gum teeth to get the price of a fishing rod out
of him. When I think of all the fun I might have
bought with a few dollars, it makes me wild. You
can&#8217;t buy fun when you get old; you may buy an
opera house or a yacht, but you can&#8217;t buy the real
stuff that makes life worth living.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl glanced out of the window at the park, then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
as though she had found some inspiration there, she
turned to Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind about the money, then why
don&#8217;t you let me live here instead of letting the place?
I can live here by myself and I would be happy here.
I won&#8217;t be happy if I leave it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Pinckney, &#8220;there&#8217;s your father&#8217;s
wish, first of all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure if he knew how I felt, he wouldn&#8217;t
mind,&#8221; said Phyl mournfully, turning her gaze again
to the park.</p>
<p>&#8220;On top of that,&#8221; went on Pinckney, &#8220;there&#8217;s&mdash;your
age. Phyl, it wouldn&#8217;t ever do; it&#8217;s not I that
am saying it, it&#8217;s custom, the world, society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl, like the hooked salmon that has taken the
gaudy fly, felt a check and recognised that a Power
had her in hand, recognised in the light-going and
fair-speaking Pinckney something of adamant, a will
not to be broken or bent.</p>
<p>She felt for a moment a revolt against herself for
having fallen to the lure and allowed herself to come
to friendly terms with him. Then this feeling faded
a bit. The very young are very weak in the face
of constituted authority&mdash;besides, there was always
at the back of Pinckney her father&#8217;s wish.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then again, on top of that,&#8221; he went on,
&#8220;there&#8217;s the question of your coming to live with us;
your father wished it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In America!&#8221; cried Phyl. &#8220;Do you mean I am
to live in America?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we live there; why not? It&#8217;s not a bad
place to live in&mdash;and what else are you to do?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>She could not answer him. This time she saw
that the bogey man had got her and no mistake.
America to her seemed as far as the moon and far
less familiar. If Pinckney had declared that it was
necessary for her to die, she would have been a great
deal more frightened, but the prospect would not
have seemed much more desolate and forbidding and
final.</p>
<p>He saw at once the trouble in her mind and
guessed the cause. He had a rare intuition for reading
minds, and it seemed to him he could read Phyl&#8217;s
as easily as though the outside of her head were clear
glass&mdash;he had cause to modify this cocksure opinion
later on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t like
America when you see it, you can come back to Ireland.
I daresay we can arrange something; anyhow,
don&#8217;t let us meet troubles half way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When am I to go?&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, Phyl, you can stay as long as you like with
us,&#8221; said Mr. Hennessey. &#8220;The doors of 10, Merrion
Square, are always open to you, and never will
they be shut on you except behind your back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinckney laughed; and a servant coming in to
clear the breakfast things, Hennessey led the way
from the room to show Pinckney the premises.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p>They crossed the hall, and passing through a
green-baize covered door went down a passage
that led to the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the housekeeper&#8217;s room,&#8221; said Hennessey,
pointing to a half open door, &#8220;and the servants&#8217;
hall is that door beyond. This is the kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>They paused for a moment in the great old-fashioned
kitchen, with an open range capable of roasting
a small ox, one might have fancied. Norah, the
cook, was busy in the scullery with her sleeves tucked
up, and under the table was seated Susie Gallagher,
a small and grubby hanger-on engaged in the task of
washing potatoes. The potatoes were beside her
on the floor and she was washing them in a tin basin
of water with the help of an old nail-brush.</p>
<p>There was a horse-shoe hung up, for luck, on the
wall over the range, and a pile of dinner plates, from
last night&#8217;s dinner and still unwashed, stood on the
dresser, where also stood a half-bottle of Guinness&#8217;
stout and a tumbler; an old setter bitch lay before
the fire and a jackdaw in a wicker cage set up a yell
at the sight of the visitors, that brought Norah out
of the scullery to receive them, a broad smile on her
face and her arms tucked up in her apron.</p>
<p>&#8220;He always yells like that at the sight of tramps
or stray people about,&#8221; apologised the cook. &#8220;He&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
better than a watch-dog. Hold your tongue, you
baste; don&#8217;t you know your misthress when you see
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rafferty caught him in the park,&#8221; said Phyl, &#8220;and
cut his tongue with a sixpence so as to make him
able to speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>They left the kitchen and came into the yard. A
big tin can of refuse was standing by the kitchen
door, and on top of all sorts of rubbish, potato peelings,
cabbage stalks and so forth, lay the carcass of
a boiled fowl. It was the fowl they had dined off
the night before and it lay there just as it had gone
from the table, that is to say, minus both wings and
the greater part of the breast, but with the legs
intact.</p>
<p>Pinckney stared at this sinful sight. Then he
pointed to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that doing there?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Waitin&#8217; to be took away be the stable boy, sor,&#8221;
replied the cook, who had followed them to the door.
&#8220;All the rubbish is took away in that ould can every
mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; said Pinckney under his breath.
The expression was shaken out of him, so to speak,
and out of a pocket of his character which had never
been fully explored, of whose existence, indeed, he
was not particularly aware. This Irish expedition
was to show him a good many things in life and in
himself of which up to this he had been in ignorance.
He had never been brought face to face with waste,
bald waste without a hat on or covering of any sort,
before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you any poor people about here?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hapes, sor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinckney was on the point of saying something
more, but he checked himself, remembering that in
the eyes of the servants he was here in the position
of a guest.</p>
<p>He followed Hennessey across to the stable yard,
where Larry, the groom, was washing the carriage
that had fetched him from the station the night
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;The servants won&#8217;t eat chicken,&#8221; said Phyl, in an
apologetic way. She had noted everything and she
guessed his thoughts. &#8220;They won&#8217;t eat game either&mdash;and
they throw things away if they don&#8217;t like them&mdash;of
course, it&#8217;s wasteful, but they <i>do</i> give things to
the poor. Lots of poor people come here, every
day nearly, but they don&#8217;t care for scraps&mdash;you see,
it <i>is</i> insulting to give a poor person scraps, just as
though they were animals. I remember the cook we
had before Norah did it when she came first, and all
the poor people stopped coming to the house. Said
she ought to know better than to offer them the
leavings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheek!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Phyl. &#8220;We&#8217;ve done it
for hundreds of years.&#8221;</p>
<p>She closed her mouth in a way she had when she
did not wish to pursue a subject further. Despite
the fact that she had made friends with Pinckney,
she was galled by his attitude of criticism. Guardian
or no guardian, he was a stranger; relation or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
no relation, he was a stranger, and what right had a
stranger to dare to come and turn up his nose at the
poor people or make remarks&mdash;he hadn&#8217;t said a
word&mdash;about the wastefulness of the servants?</p>
<p>The redoubtable Rafferty was standing in the yard
chewing a straw and watching Larry at work.</p>
<p>Rafferty was a man of genius, who had started as
a helper and odd job person, and had risen to the
position of factotum. He had ousted the Scotch
gardener and insinuated a relation of his own in his
place. There was scarcely a servant about the estate
that was not a relation of Rafferty&#8217;s. Philip
Berknowles had put up with a lot from Rafferty
simply because Rafferty was an invaluable person in
his way when not crossed. Everything went
smoothly when the factotum was not interfered with.
Cross him and there were immediate results ranging
from ill-groomed horses to general unrest. He was
a dark individual, half groom, half game-keeper in
dress, a &#8220;wicked-looking divil,&#8221; according to the
description of his enemies, and an exceedingly foxy-looking
individual in the eyes of Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rafferty,&#8221; said Mr. Hennessey, &#8220;I want to show
this gentleman round. Let&#8217;s see the stables.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rafferty touched his cap and led the way, showing
first the stalls and boxes where four or five horses
were stabled, and then leading the way through the
coach-house to the path from which opened the
kitchen gardens.</p>
<p>They were immense and walled in with red brick,
capable, one might fancy, of supplying the wants of
three or four houses the size of Kilgobbin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>Pinckney noted this fact, also that the home farm
to which the kitchen gardens led was apparently a
prosperous and going little concern, with its fowls
and chickens penned or loose, styes filled with grunting
pigs, and turkeys gobbling and spreading their
tails in the sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who looks after all this?&#8221; asked Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, sor,&#8221; replied Rafferty.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are the takings?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, sor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The profits, I mean. You sell these things, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kilgobbin isn&#8217;t a farm, sor, it&#8217;s a gintleman&#8217;s
estate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinckney, not at all set back by this snub, turned
and looked the factotum in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve never heard of gentlemen
growing pigs to look at; peacocks, maybe, but
not pigs. However, we&#8217;ll have another look at the
business later.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and they went on, Rafferty disturbed
in his mind and much put about by the manner of the
other in whom he began to divine something more
than a casual guest, Phyl almost as much put out as
Rafferty.</p>
<p>The idea that the factotum might have been robbing
her father right and left never occurred to her;
even if it had, it would not have softened the fact
that a strange hand was at work in her old home
turning over things, inspecting them, holding them
up for comment.</p>
<p>She managed to drop behind as they left the farm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
yard for the paddocks, then turning down the yew
lane that led back to the house, she ran as though
hounds were after her, reached the house, locked
herself in her bedroom, and flung herself on the bed
in a tempest of weeping, dragging a pillow over her
head as if to shield herself from the blows that the
world was aiming at her.</p>
<p>Phyl, without mother, brothers or sisters, had
centred all her affection on her father and Kilgobbin;
the servants, the place itself and all the things
and people about it were part and parcel with her
life, and the death of her father had intensified her
love of the place and the people.</p>
<p>If Pinckney had only known, he might have put
the business of the inspection of the property and
the dealing with the servants into other hands, but
Pinckney was young and full of energy and business
ability; he was full of conscientiousness and the determination
to protect his ward&#8217;s interests; he had
scented a rogue in Rafferty, and at this very minute
returning to the house with Hennessey, he was declaring
his intention to make an overhaul of the
working of the estate.</p>
<p>Rafferty was to appear before him and produce
his accounts and make explanations. Mrs. Driscoll
was to be examined as to the expenditure, etc.</p>
<p>He little knew the hornet&#8217;s nest into which he was
about to poke his finger.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p>The grand inquisition began that evening after
dinner&mdash;Phyl did not appear at dinner, alleging
a headache&mdash;and Rafferty, summoned to the
library, had to stand whilst Pinckney, seated at the
table with a pen in his hand and a sheet of paper
before him, went into the business of accounts.</p>
<p>Mark how the unexpected occurs in life. Rafferty,
who had been pilfering for years, selling garden
produce and keeping the profits, robbing corn
from the corn bin in the stable, poaching and selling
birds and ground game to a dealer in Arranakilty,
receiving illicit commissions and so forth, had on the
death of his master shaken off all restraint and
prepared for a campaign of open plunder. The
very last thing he could have imagined was the sudden
appearance of an American business man on the
scene, armed with absolute power and possessing the
eye of a hawk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your master asked me just before he died to look
after this estate,&#8221; began Pinckney; &#8220;in fact, he has
appointed me to act as guardian to Miss Berknowles,
so I just want to see how things stand. Now, to
begin with the horses. I want to know everything
about the stables during the last&mdash;shall we say&mdash;six
months. Who supplies the corn and the hay and
the straw?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been gettin&#8217; some from Faulkner of Arranakilty,
sor, and some from Doyle of Bally-brack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you grow any horse food on the estate?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t grow no corn, sor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, hay and straw?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get straw, sor, widout you grow
corn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that&mdash;but how about hay&mdash;surely you
grow lots of grass?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We graze the grass, sor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you let the grazing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sor, it&#8217;s this way; the masther was never
very shtrict about the grazin&#8217;; we puts some of the
horses out to grass, ourselves, and we lets poor folk
have a bit of grazin&#8217; now and then for their cattle,
though master was never after makin&#8217; money from
the estate&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so. Have you the receipted bills for the
fodder during the last six months?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sor. The master always sent me wid the
money to pay the bills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have got the receipts?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The which, sor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The bills receipted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bills, sure, what&#8217;s the good of keepin&#8217; bills, sor,
when the money&#8217;s paid. I b&#8217;lave they&#8217;re somewhere
in an ould crock in the stable, at laste that&#8217;s where
I saw thim last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Pinckney, &#8220;you can fetch them for
me to-morrow morning, and now let&#8217;s talk about the
garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rafferty, not knowing what Pinckney might discover
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
and so being unable to lie with confidence, had
a very bad quarter of an hour over the garden.</p>
<p>Pinckney was not a man to press another unduly,
nor was he a man to haggle about halfpence or worry
servants over small peccadillos. He knew quite
well that grooms are grooms, and will be so as long as
men are men. He would never have bothered about
little details had Rafferty been an ordinary servant.
He recognised in Rafferty, not a servant to be dismissed
or corrected, but an antagonist to be fought.
It was the case of the dog and badger. Rafferty was
Graft and all it implies, Pinckney was Straight Dealing.
And Straight Dealing knew quite well that the
only way to get Graft by the throat is to ferret out
details, no matter how small.</p>
<p>So Rafferty was taken over details. He had to
admit that he had &#8220;given away&#8221; some of the stuff
from the garden and sold &#8220;a bit,&#8221; sending it up to
Dublin for that purpose; but he was not to be caught.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the profits,&#8221; said Pinckney. &#8220;I suppose you
handed them over to Mr. Berknowles?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sor; the master always tould me to keep any
bit of money I might draa from anything I planted
extra for me perkisites, that was the understandin&#8217; I
had with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And over the farmyard, I suppose anything you
could make by selling any extra animals you planted
was your perquisite?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, Rafferty, that will do for to-night;
get me those receipted bills to-morrow morning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
Come here at ten o&#8217;clock and we will have another
talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rafferty went off, feeling more comfortable in his
mind.</p>
<p>The word Perquisites might be made to cover a
multitude of sins, but he would not have been so
easy if he had known that Mrs. Driscoll had been
called up immediately after his departure. Mrs.
Driscoll was one of those terrible people who say
nothing yet see everything; for the last year and a
half she had been watching Rafferty; knowing it to
be quite useless to report what she knew to her easy-going
master, she had, none the less, kept on watching.
As a result, she was now able to bring up a
hard fact, a small hard fact more valuable than
worlds of ductile evidence. Rafferty had &#8220;nicked&#8221;&mdash;it
was the lady&#8217;s expression&mdash;a brand-new lawn
mower.</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare to God, sir, I don&#8217;t know what he <i>has</i>
took, for me eyes can&#8217;t be everywhere, but I do know
he&#8217;s took the mower.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you not tell Miss Phyl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, sir, and she only said, &#8216;Oh, there must be a
mistake&mdash;what would he be doin&#8217; with it,&#8217; says she.
&#8216;Sellin&#8217; it,&#8217; says I. &#8216;Nonsense,&#8217; says she. You see,
sir, Rafferty and she has always been hand in glove,
what with the fishin&#8217; and shootin&#8217;, and the horses and
such like, and she won&#8217;t hear a word against him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Driscoll had called Rafferty a sly devil&mdash;he
was.</p>
<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock next morning, Phyl, crossing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
stable yard with some sugar for the horses, met Rafferty.
He was crying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what on earth&#8217;s the matter, Rafferty?&#8221;
asked the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got the shove, miss,&#8221; replied Rafferty, &#8220;after
all me years of service, I&#8217;m put out to end me days
in a ditch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you&#8217;re discharged!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Was
it Mr. Pinckney?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s him,&#8221; replied Rafferty. &#8220;Says he&#8217;s the
masther of us all. &#8216;Out you get,&#8217; says he, &#8216;or it&#8217;s I
that&#8217;ll be callin&#8217; a p&#8217;leeceman to put you,&#8217; says he.
Flung it in me face that I&#8217;d stolen a laan mower.
Me that&#8217;s ben on the estate man and boy for forty
year. A laan mower! Sure, Miss Phyl, what
would I be doin&#8217; with a laan mower?&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl turned from him and ran to the house.
Pinckney and Hennessey were seated in the library
when the door burst open and in came Phyl. Her
eyes were bright and her lips were pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;You told me you would keep all the servants,&#8221;
said she. &#8220;Rafferty tells me you have dismissed
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think I had,&#8221; said Pinckney lightly, and
not gauging the mad disturbance of the other, &#8220;and
it&#8217;s lucky for him I haven&#8217;t put him in prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>The word prison was all that was wanted to fire
the mine. Pinckney stood for a moment aghast at
the change in the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>hate</i> you,&#8221; she cried, coming a step closer to
him. &#8220;I loathe you&mdash;master of us all, are you?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
Dare to touch any one here and I&#8217;ll burn the house
down with my own hands&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused for want of breath, her chest heaving
and her hands clenched.</p>
<p>Then Pinckney exploded.</p>
<p>The good old fiery Pinckney blood was up. Oh,
without any manner of doubt our ancestors are still
able to speak, and it was old Roderick Pinckney&mdash;&#8220;Pepper
Pinckney&#8221; was his nickname&mdash;that blazed
out now. It was also the fire of youth answering the
fire of youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ve come here to do my
best&mdash;I don&#8217;t care&mdash;keep who you want&mdash;be robbed
if you like it&mdash;I&#8217;m off&mdash;&#8221; He caught up all the
sheets of paper he had been covering with figures
and tore them across.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beast!&#8221; cried Phyl.</p>
<p>She rushed from the room and upstairs like a mad
creature. The bang of her bedroom door closed
the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t be taking on so,&#8221; said Hennessey.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve both of you lost your temper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lost my temper&mdash;maybe. I&#8217;m going all the
same. Right back to the States. I&#8217;m off to Dublin
by the next train and you&#8217;d better come and finish
the business there. You&#8217;d better have her to stay
with you in Dublin. I don&#8217;t want to see her again.
Anyhow, we&#8217;ll settle all that later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s the best,&#8221; said Hennessey. &#8220;My
wife will look after her till she&#8217;s ready to go to the
States&mdash;if she wants to.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Please God she doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the other.</p>
<p>Phyl did not see Pinckney again. He went off to
Dublin by the two-ten train with Hennessey, the latter
promising to be back on the morrow to arrange
things.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p>Dublin can never have been a cheerful city.
Even in the days when the butchers joined in
street fights and hung their antagonists when caught
on steel hooks&mdash;like legs of mutton&mdash;the gaiety of
Dublin one may fancy to have been more a matter
of spirits than of spirit.</p>
<p>Echoes from the days when the Parliament sat in
Stephen&#8217;s Green come down to us through the works
of Charles Lever, but the riotous gaiety of the old
days when Barrington was a judge of the Admiralty
Court, the Hell Fire Club an institution, and Count
Considine a figure in society, must be taken with a
grain of salt.</p>
<p>Mangan shows you the old Dublin as it was in
those glorious times, and in the new Dublin of to-day
the shade of Mangan seems still to walk arm in arm
with the shade of Mathurin. Gloomy ghosts addicted
to melancholy, noting with satisfaction that
the streets are as dirty as ever, the old Public Houses
still standing, that, despite the tramways&mdash;those
extraordinary new modern inventions&mdash;the tide of
life runs pretty much the same as of old. The ghosts
of Mangan and Mathurin have never seen a taxi cab.</p>
<p>Dublin at the present day is a splendid city for old
ghosts to wander in without having their corns
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
trodden on or their susceptibilities injured. Phyl
had come to Dublin to live with the Hennesseys in
Merrion Square.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never shall my door be shut on you except behind
your back,&#8221; Hennessey had said, and he meant it.</p>
<p>The girl was worth several thousand a year; had
she been penniless it would have been just the same.</p>
<p>You may meet many geniuses in your journey
through life, many brilliant people, many beautiful
people, many fascinating people, but you will not
meet many friends. Hennessey belonged to the
society of Friends, his wife was a member of the
same community, and he would have been ruined
only for his partner Niven, who was an ordinary lowdown
human creature who believed in no one and
kept the business together.</p>
<p>On the day of her arrival at Merrion Square and
during her first interview with Mrs. Hennessey in
the large, cheerless drawing-room where decalcomanied
flower pots lingered like relics of the Palæolithic
age of Art, Phyl kept herself above tears, just
as a swimmer keeps his head above water in a
choppy sea.</p>
<p>It was all so gloomy, yet so friendly, that the mind
could not openly revolt at the gloom; it was all so
different from the wind and trees and freedom of
Kilgobbin, and Mrs. Hennessey, whom she had only
seen once before, was so different, on closer acquaintance,
from any of the people she had hitherto met in
her little world.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hennessey, with a soul above dust and
housekeeping, a faded woman, not very tidy, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
an exalted air, pouring out tea from a Britannia metal ware teapot
and talking all the time about
Willy Yeates, the Irish Players and Lady Gregory&#8217;s
last play, fascinated the girl, who did not know
who Willy Yeates was and who had never seen the
Irish Players.</p>
<p>Nor could she learn from Mrs. Hennessey. It
was impossible to get a word in edgeways with that
lady. Sometimes, indeed, during a lull in her mind
disturbance, she would remain quiet whilst you
answered some question, only to find that she had
totally forgotten the question and was not listening
to your reply.</p>
<p>Phyl got so used to Mrs. Hennessey after a few
days that she did not listen to her questions, and so
the two being matched, they got on well together.
Young people soon accommodate themselves to their
surroundings, and in a month the girl had grown
to the colour of her new life, at least, on the outside
of her mind. It seemed to her that she had lived
years in Merrion Square. Kilgobbin&mdash;Hennessey
had managed to let the place&mdash;seemed a dream of
her childhood. She saw no future, and rebellion
was impossible; there was nothing to rebel against&mdash;except
the dulness and greyness of life. No people
could have been kinder than the Hennesseys; unfortunately
they had numerous friends, and the friends
of the Hennesseys did not appeal to Phyl.</p>
<p>A boy in her position would have adapted himself
quickly enough, and been hail fellow well met with
Mr. Mattram, the dentist of Westland Row, or the
young Farrels, whose father owned one of the biggest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
wine merchants&#8217; businesses in the city; but the
feminine instinct told Phyl that these were not the
sort of people from whose class she had sprung, that
their circle was not her circle and that she had
stepped down in life in some mysterious way. This
fact was brought sharply home to her by a young
Farrel, a male of the Farrel brood, a hobbledehoy,
good-looking enough but with a Dublin accent and a
cheeky manner.</p>
<p>This immature wine merchant at a party given by
Mrs. Hennessey had made love to Phyl and had tried
to kiss her behind the dining-room door.</p>
<p>The recollection of the smack in the face she had
given him soothed her that night as she lay tossing
in her bed, and it was on this night and for the first
time since she left Kilgobbin that the recollection of
Pinckney came before her otherwise than as a
shadow. He stood with the Hennessey circle as his
background, a bright, good-looking figure and a gentleman
to his finger-tips.</p>
<p>Why had she cast aside her own people&mdash;even
though they were distant relations? What stupidity
had caused her to insult Pinckney by telling him she
hated him? She found herself asking that question
without being able to answer it.</p>
<p>After all that fuss at Kilgobbin and Pinckney&#8217;s
departure, Mr. Hennessey had proved to her that
Rafferty was a rogue who deserved no quarter; the
man had been dismissed, the whole business was done
with and over, and now, looking back in cool blood,
she was utterly unable to reconstruct and put together
the reasons for the outburst of anger that had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
severed her from the one kinsman who had put out
his hand to help her.</p>
<p>She could no longer conjure up the feeling that
Pinckney was an interloper come to break up Kilgobbin
and spoil the home she had known from
childhood.</p>
<p>Fate had done that. Kilgobbin was gone&mdash;let to
strangers; Hennessey had taken over her guardianship
<i>pro tem</i>, and it was entirely owing to herself
that she was in her present position. She had no
right to criticise the friends of the Hennesseys; she
had deliberately walked into that circle from which
she felt she never could escape now.</p>
<p>Just as Pinckney had discovered that guardianship
was showing him traits in his character hitherto unknown
to him, Phyl was discovering her woman&#8217;s
instinct as regards social matters.</p>
<p>She recognised that once having taken her place
amongst the Hennessey set, her position for life was
fixed, as far as Ireland was concerned. She was
branded.</p>
<p>The Berknowles were an old family, but she was
the last of them. The relatives living in the south
could be no help to her; they were poor, rabid Catholics
and had fallen to little account, owing to unwise
marriages and that irresponsible fatuous apathy in
affairs which is the dry rot of Ireland and the Irish
people. They were proud as Lucifer, but no one
was proud of them.</p>
<p>If only Philip Berknowles had been a man to make
fast friends amongst his own class, some of those
friends might have come to his daughter&#8217;s rescue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
now. But Berknowles had lived his own life since
the death of his wife, an easy-going country gentleman
in a county mostly inhabited by squireens and
cottage folk, caring little for the <i>convenances</i> and
with no taste for women&#8217;s society.</p>
<p>Thoughts born of all these facts, some of which
were only half understood, filled the mind of the girl
as she lay awake with the noise of that raucous
party ringing in her ears; and when she fell asleep, it
was only to awake with a sense of despondency
weighing upon her and the odious Farrel incident
waiting to follow her through the day.</p>
<p>About a week later, coming down to breakfast one
morning, she found a letter on her plate. A letter
with American stamps on it and the address, Miss
Phylice Berknowles, Merrion Square, Dublin, Ireland,
written in a firm, bold hand.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hennessey was not down and Mr. Hennessey
had departed for the office, so Phyl had the
breakfast table to herself&mdash;and the letter.</p>
<p>She knew at once whom it was from, even before
she read the postmark, &#8220;Charleston.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinckney, the man who had been in her thoughts
during the past six or seven days, the man who had
left Ireland righteously disgusted with her, the man
to whom she had said, &#8220;I hate you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The scene flashed before her as she tore the envelope
open, his sudden blaze of anger, the way he
had torn the papers up, his departure. What was
he going to say to her now? She flushed at the
thought that this thing in her hand might prove
to be his opinion of her in cold blood, a reproof,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
a remonstrance&mdash;she opened the folded sheet&mdash;ah!</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Dear Phyl,</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Maria was greatly disappointed when I
returned here without you, she had quite made up
her mind that you were coming back with me. We
both lost our temper that day, but I was the worse,
for I said a word I shouldn&#8217;t have said, and for
which I apologise. Aunt Maria says it was the
Pinckney temper. However that may be, we shall
be delighted to see you. Mrs. Van Dusen leaves
on the 6th of next month. I am sending all particulars
to Mr. Hennessey. You could meet Mrs.
Van Dusen at Liverpool and go with her as far as
New York. Let me have a cable to know if you are
coming. Pinckney, Vernons, Charleston, U. S. A.,
is the cable address.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;Your affectionate guardian&mdash;also cousin&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>R. Pinckney.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Then underneath, in an angular, old-fashioned
hand, one of those handwritings we associate with
crossed letters, rosewood desks, valentines and
wafers:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Be sure to come. I am very anxious to see you,
and I only hope you will like me as much as I am
sure to like you.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Maria Pinckney.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Phyl caught her breath back when she read this
and her eyes filled with tears. It was the woman&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
voice that touched her, coming after Pinckney&#8217;s business-like
and jerky sentences.</p>
<p>Then she sat with the letter before her, looking
at the new prospect it had opened for her.</p>
<p>Was Pinckney still angry, despite his talk about
the Pinckney temper; had he written not of his own
free will but at the desire of Maria Pinckney? She
read the thing over again without finding any solution
to this question.</p>
<p>But one fact was clear. Maria Pinckney was
genuine in her invitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>She rose up from the table as though determined
then and there to start off for America, left the room,
went upstairs and knocked at Mrs. Hennessey&#8217;s door.</p>
<p>That lady was sitting up in bed with a stocking tied
round her throat&mdash;she was suffering from a slight
attack of tonsilitis&mdash;and the Irish <i>Times</i> spread on
her knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Hennessey,&#8221; said Phyl, &#8220;I have just had a
letter from my cousins in America, and they want me
to go out to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Want you to go to America!&#8221; said Mrs. Hennessey.
&#8220;On a visit, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, to stay there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To stay in America; but what on earth do they
want you to do that for? Who on earth would
dream of leaving Dublin to live in America! It&#8217;s
extraordinary the ideas some people get hold of.
Then, of course, they don&#8217;t know, that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s to
be said for them. It&#8217;s like hearing people talking
and talking of all the fine views abroad, and you&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
think they&#8217;d never seen the Dargle or the Glen of the
Downs; they don&#8217;t know the beauty of their own
country or haven&#8217;t eyes to see it, and they must go
raving of the Bay of Naples with Kiliney Bay a
stone&#8217;s throw away from them, and talking of Paris
with Dublin outside their doors, and praising up
foreign actors with never a word of the Irish Players.
Dublin giving her best to them, and they with deaf
ears to her music and blind eyes to her sons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, you see, Mrs. Hennessey, the Pinckneys are
my relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Irish?&#8221; cried the good woman, absolutely unconscious
of everything but the vision before her.
&#8220;Those that can&#8217;t see their own land aren&#8217;t Irish.
Mongrels is the name for them, without pride of
heart or light of understanding.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was off.</p>
<p>With a far, fixed gaze and her mind in a state of
internal combustion, she seemed a thousand miles
away from Phyl and her affairs, fighting the battles
of Ireland.</p>
<p>Phyl gathered the impression that, if she went to
America Mrs. Hennessey would grieve less over the
fact that she (Phyl) was leaving Merrion Square,
than over the fact that she was leaving Dublin. She
escaped, carrying this impression with her, went upstairs,
dressed, and then started off for Mr. Hennessey&#8217;s
office.</p>
<p>It was a cold, bright day and Dublin looked almost
cheerful in the sunlight.</p>
<p>The lawyer looked surprised when she was shown
into his private room; then, when she had told him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
her business, he fumbled amongst the papers on his
desk and produced a letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is from Pinckney,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It came by
the same post as yours, only it was directed to the
office. It&#8217;s the same story, too. He wants you to
go over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking over the whole business,&#8221; said
Phyl, &#8220;and I feel I ought to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you happy in Dublin?&#8221; asked he.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;yes,&#8221; answered the other. &#8220;But, you see&mdash;at
least, I&#8217;m as happy as I suppose I&#8217;ll be anywhere,
only they are my people and I feel I ought to go to
them. It&#8217;s very lonely to have no people of one&#8217;s
own. You and Mrs. Hennessey have been very kind
to me, and I shall always be grateful, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we aren&#8217;t your own flesh and blood. You&#8217;re
right. Well, there it is. We&#8217;ll be sorry to lose you,
but, maybe, though you haven&#8217;t much experience of
the world, you&#8217;ve hit the nail on the head. We
aren&#8217;t your flesh and blood, and though the Pinckneys
aren&#8217;t much more to you, still, one drop of
blood makes all the difference in the world. Then
again, you&#8217;re a cut above us; we&#8217;re quite simple
people, but the Berknowles were always in the Castle
set and a long chalk above the Hennesseys. I was
saying that to Norah only last night when I was reading
the account of the big party at the Viceregal
Lodge and the names of all the people that were
there, and I said to her, &#8216;Phyl ought to be going to
parties like that by and by when she grows older,
and we can&#8217;t do much for her in that way,&#8217; and off
she goes in a temper. &#8216;Who&#8217;s the Aberdeens?&#8217; says
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
she. &#8216;A lot of English without an Irish feather in
their tails, and he opening the doors to visitors in his
dressing gown&mdash;Castle,&#8217; she says, &#8216;it&#8217;s little Castle
there&#8217;ll be when we have a Parliament sitting in
Dublin.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go to parties at the Viceregal
Lodge,&#8221; said Phyl, flushing to think of what a snob
she had been when only a few days back she had
criticised the Hennesseys and their set in her own
mind. These honest, straightforward good people
were not snobs, whatever else they might be, and if
her desire for America had been prompted solely by
the desire to escape from the social conditions that
environed her friends, she would now have smothered
it and stamped on it. But the call from
Charleston that had come across the water to her was
an influence far more potent than that. That call
from the country where her mother had been born
and where her mother&#8217;s people had always lived had
more in it than the voices that carried the message.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hennessey, &#8220;you mayn&#8217;t want to go
to parties now, but you will when you are a bit older.
However, you can please yourself&mdash;Do you want to
go to America?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Phyl. &#8220;It&#8217;s not that I want to leave
you, but there is something that tells me I have got
to go. When I read the letter first this morning, I
was delighted to think that Mr. Pinckney was not
still angry with me, and I liked the idea of the
change, for Dublin is a bit dreary after Kilgobbin
and&mdash;and well, I <i>will</i> say it&mdash;I don&#8217;t care for some
of the people I have met in Dublin. But since then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
a new feeling has come over me. I think it came as
I was walking down here to the office. It&#8217;s a feeling
as if something were pulling me ever so slightly, yet
still pulling me from over there. My father said
that there was more of mother in me than him. I
remember he said that once&mdash;well, perhaps it&#8217;s that.
She came from over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it is,&#8221; said Hennessey.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p>The thing was settled definitely that night,
Mrs. Hennessey resisting the idea at first,
more, one might have fancied from her talk, because
the idea was anti-national than from love of Phyl,
though, as a matter of fact, she was fond enough of
the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s what&#8217;s left Ireland what it is,&#8221; went on the
good lady. &#8220;Cripples and lunatics, that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s
left of us with your emigration; all the good blood
of Ireland flowing away from her and not a drop,
scarcely, coming back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come back,&#8221; said Phyl, &#8220;you need not fear
about that&mdash;some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, some day,&#8221; said Mrs. Hennessey, and stared
into the fire. Then the spirit moving her, she began
to discant on things past and people vanished.</p>
<p>Synge, and Oscar Wilde and Willie Wilde, who
was the real genius of the family, only his genius
&#8220;stuck in him somehow and wouldn&#8217;t come out.&#8221;
She passed from people who had vanished to places
that had changed, and only stopped when the servant
came in with the announcement that supper was
ready.</p>
<p>Then at supper, lo and behold! she discussed the
going away of Phyl, as though it were a matter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
arranged and done with and carrying her full consent
and approval.</p>
<p>During the weeks following, Phyl&#8217;s impending
journey kept Mrs. Hennessey busy in a spasmodic
way. One might have fancied from the preparations
and lists of things necessary that the girl was
off to the wilds of New Guinea or some region
equally destitute of shops.</p>
<p>Hennessey remonstrated, and then let her have
her way&mdash;it kept her quiet, and Phyl, nothing loath,
spent most of her time now in shops, Tod and Burns,
and Cannock and White&#8217;s, examining patterns and
being fitted, varying these amusements by farewell
visits. She was invited out by all the Hennesseys&#8217;
friends, the Farrels and the Rourkes, and the Longs
and the Newlands, and the Pryces and the Oldhams,
all prepared tea-parties in her honour, made her welcome,
and made much of her, just as we make much
of people who have not long to live.</p>
<p>She was the girl that was going to America. She
did not appreciate the real kindness underlying this
terrible round of festivities till she was standing on
the deck of the <i>Hybernia</i> at Kingstown saying good-bye
to Hennessey.</p>
<p>Then, as the boat drew away from the Carlisle
pier, as it passed the guardship anchorage and the
batteries at the ends of the east and west piers, all
those people from whom she had longed to escape
seemed to her the most desirable people on earth.</p>
<p>Bound for a world unknown, peopled with utter
strangers, Ireland, beloved Ireland, called after her
as a mother calls to her child.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>Oh, the loneliness! the desolation!</p>
<p>As she stood watching the Wicklow mountains
fading in the grey distance, she knew for the first
time the meaning of those words, &#8220;Gone West&#8221;; and
she knew what the thousands suffered who, driven
from their cabins on the hillside or the moor, went
West in the old days when the emigrant ship showed
her tall masts in Queenstown Harbour and her bellying
canvas to the sunset of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>At Liverpool, she found Mrs. Van Dusen, a tall,
rather good-looking, rather hard-looking but exceedingly
fashionable individual, at the hotel where it
was arranged they should meet.</p>
<p>Phyl, looking like a lost dog, confused by travel
and dumb from dejection, had little in common with
this lady, nor did a rough passage across the Atlantic
extend their knowledge of one another, for Mrs. Van
Dusen scarcely appeared from her state-room till the
evening when, the great ship coming to her moorings,
New York sketched itself and its blazing skyscrapers
against the gloom before the astonished
eyes of Phyl.

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p>Holyhead, Liverpool, New York, each of
these stopping places had impressed upon
Phyl the distance she was putting between herself and
her home, making her feel that if this business was
not death it was, at least, a very good imitation of
dying.</p>
<p>But the south-bound express from New York was
to show her just what people may be expected to feel
<i>after</i> they are dead.</p>
<p>America had been for Phyl little more than a
geographical expression. &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin,&#8221;
&#8220;The Last of the Mohicans,&#8221; &#8220;The Settlers in
Canada&#8221; and &#8220;Round the World in Eighty Days,&#8221;
had given her pictures, and from these she had built
up a vague land of snow and forests, log huts, plains,
Red Indians, runaway negroes and men with bowie
knives.</p>
<p>New York had given this fantastic idea a rough
joggle, the south-bound express tumbled it all to
pieces.</p>
<p>Forests and mountains and plains would have been
familiar to her imagination, but the south-bound express
was producing for her inspection quite different
things from these.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>New Jersey with its populous towns, for instance,
towns she never could have imagined or dreamed of,
filled with people whose existence she could not
picture.</p>
<p>What gave her a cold grue was the suddenly
grasped fact that all this great mechanism of life,
cities, towns, roaring railways, agricultural lands,
manufacturing districts filled with English speaking
people&mdash;that all this was alien, knew nothing of Ireland
or England, except as it might know of Japan or
a dream of the past.</p>
<p>The people in the train were talking English&mdash;were
English to all intents and purposes, and yet, as
far as England and Ireland were concerned, she
knew them to be dead.</p>
<p>It had been freezing in New York, a great rainstorm
was blowing across the world as they crossed
the Delaware; it passed, sweeping away east under
the arch of a vast rainbow, even the rainbow seemed
alien and different to Irish rainbows&mdash;it was too big.</p>
<p>Then came Philadelphia, where some of the dead
folk left the train and others got in. One had an
Irish voice and accent. He was a big man with a
hard, pushful face and a great under jaw. Phyl
knew him at once for what he was, and that he had
died to Ireland long years ago.</p>
<p>Then came Wilmington and Baltimore, and then,
long after sunset in the dark, a warmer air that
entered the train like a viewless passenger, nerve
soothing and mind lulling&mdash;the first breath of the
South.</p>
<p>Next morning, looking from the windows of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
car, she saw the South. Vast spaces of low-lying
land broken by river and bayou, flooded by the light
of the new risen sun and touched by a vague mist
from the sea, soft as a haze of summer, warm with
light and everywhere hinting at the blue deep sky
beyond.</p>
<p>Youth, morning, and the spirit of the sea all lay
in that luminous haze, that warm light filled with the
laziness of June; and, for one delightful moment, it
seemed to Phyl that summer days long forgotten,
rapturous mornings half remembered were here
again.</p>
<p>The rumble of trestle and boom of bridge filled
the train, and now the masts of ships showed thready
against the hazy blue of the sky; frame houses
sprang up by the track and fences with black children
roosting on them; then the mean streets of the
coloured quarter and now, as the cars slackened
speed, came the bustle that marks the end of a journey.
People were getting their light luggage
together, and as Phyl was strapping the bundle that
held her travelling rug and books, a waft of tepid,
salt-scented air came through the compartment and
on it the voice of the negro attendant rousing some
drowsy passenger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charleston, sah.&#8221;</p>
<p>She got out, dazed and numbed by the journey,
and stood with the rug bundle in her hand looking
about her, half undecided what to do, half absorbed
by the bustle and movement of the platform.</p>
<p>Then, pushing towards her through the crowd,
she saw Pinckney.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>He had come to meet her, and as they shook
hands, Phyl laughed.</p>
<p>He seemed so bright and cheerful, and the relief
at finding a friend after that long, friendless journey
was so great that she laughed right out with pleasure,
like a little child&mdash;laughed right into his eyes.</p>
<p>It seemed to Pinckney that he had never seen the
real Phyl before.</p>
<p>He took the bundle from her and gave it to a
negro servant, and then, giving the luggage checks
to the servant and leaving him to bring on the luggage,
he led the girl through the crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll walk to the house,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if you are
not too tired; it&#8217;s only a few steps away&mdash;well&mdash;how
do you like America?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;America?&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;it&#8217;s different
from what I thought it would be, ever so much
different&mdash;and this place&mdash;why, it is like summer
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the South,&#8221; said Pinckney. &#8220;Look, this is
Meeting Street.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had turned from the street leading from the
station into a broad, beautiful highway, placid, sun
flooded, and leading away to the Battery, that chief
pride and glory of Charleston.</p>
<p>On either side of the street, half hidden by their
garden walls, large stately houses of the Georgian
era showed themselves. Mansions that had slumbered
in the sun for a hundred years, great, solid
houses whose yellow-wash seemed the incrustation
left by golden and peaceful afternoons, houses of old
English solidity yet with the Southern touch of deep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
verandas and the hint of palm trees in their jealously
walled gardens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how beautiful!&#8221; said Phyl. She stopped,
looked about her, and then gazed away down the
street. It was as though the old stately street&mdash;and
surely the Street of Other Days might be its name&mdash;had
been waiting for her all her life, waiting for her
to turn that corner leading from the commonplace
station, waiting to greet her like the ghost of some
friend of childhood. Surely she knew it! Like
the recollection of a dream once dreamed, it lay before
her with its walled gardens, its vaguely familiar
houses, its sunlight and placidity.</p>
<p>Pinckney, proud of his native town and pleased
at this appreciation of it, stood by without speaking,
watching the girl who seemed to have forgotten his
existence for a moment. Her head was raised as if
she were inhaling the sea wind lazily blowing from
the Battery, and bearing with it stray scents from
the gardens by the way.</p>
<p>Then she came back to herself, and they walked
on.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as if I knew the place,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and
yet I never remember seeing anything like it before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve felt that way sometimes about places,&#8221; said
Pinckney. &#8220;It seemed to me that I knew Paris
quite well when I went there, though I&#8217;d never been
there before. Charleston is pretty English, anyway,
and maybe it&#8217;s that that makes it seem familiar.
But I&#8217;m glad you like it. You like it, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Like it!&#8221; said she. &#8220;I should think I did&mdash;It&#8217;s
more than liking&mdash;I love it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better than Dublin?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was her turn to laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never loved Dublin.&#8221; She turned her head to
glance at a peep of garden showing through a
wrought iron gate. &#8220;Oh, Dublin!&mdash;don&#8217;t talk to
me about it here. I want to keep on feeling I&#8217;m
here really and that there&#8217;s nowhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t,&#8221; said he, disclosing for the first time
in his life, and quite unconsciously, his passion for
the place where he had been born. &#8220;There&#8217;s nowhere
else but Charleston worth anything&mdash;I don&#8217;t
know what it is about, but it&#8217;s so.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were passing a wall across whose top peeped
an elbow of ivy geranium. It was as though the
unseen garden beyond, tired of constraint and
drowsily stretching, had disclosed this hint of a
geranium coloured arm.</p>
<p>Pinckney paused at a wrought iron gate and
opened it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Vernons,&#8221; said he.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p>A grosbeak was singing in the magnolia tree
by the gate and the warmth of the morning
sun was filling the garden with a heart-snatching
perfume of jessamine.</p>
<p>Jessamine and the faint bitterness of sun warmed
foliage.</p>
<p>It was a garden sure to be haunted by birds; not
large and, though well kept, not trim, and sing the
birds as loud as they might, they never could break
the charm of silence cast by Time on this magic spot.</p>
<p>In the centre of the lawn stood a dial, inscribed
with the old dial motto:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 1.47167034584253em;'>The Hours Pass and are Numbered.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Phyl paused for a moment just as she had paused
in the street, and Pinckney looking at her noticed
again that uptilt of the head, and that far away look
as of a person who is trying to remember or straining
to hear.</p>
<p>Then a voice from the house came across the
broad veranda leading from the garden to the
lower rooms.</p>
<p>A female voice that seemed laughing and scolding
at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinah! Dinah! bless the girl, will she never
learn sense&mdash; Dinah! Ah, there you are. How
often have I told you to put General Grant in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
sun first thing in the morning?&mdash; You&#8217;ve been
dusting! I&#8217;ll dust you. Here, get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Out on the veranda, parrot cage in hand, came
a most surprising lady. Antique yet youthful,
dressed as ladies were wont to dress of a morning in
long forgotten years, bright eyed, and wrathfully
agitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt,&#8221; cried Pinckney. &#8220;Here we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun was in Miss Pinckney&#8217;s eyes; she put the
cage down, shaded her eyes and stared full at Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless me!&#8221; said Miss Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Phyl,&#8221; said he, as they came up to the
verandah steps.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney, seeming not to hear him in the
least, took the girl by both hands, and holding her
so as if for inspection stared at her.</p>
<p>Then she turned on Pinckney with a snap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me&mdash;she&#8217;s&mdash;why, she&#8217;s a
Mascarene. Well, of all the astonishing things in
the world&mdash; Child&mdash;child, where did you get that
face?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Phyl could answer this recondite question,
she found herself enveloped in frills and a vague
perfume of stephanotis. Maria Pinckney had taken
her literally to her heart, and was kissing her as
people kiss small children, kissing her and half crying
at the same time, whilst Pinckney stood by wondering.</p>
<p>He thought that he knew everything about Maria
Pinckney, just as he had fancied he knew himself
till Phyl had shewn him, over there in Ireland, that
there were a lot of things in his mind and character
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
still to be known by himself. This, as regards him,
seemed the special mission of Phyl in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the likeness,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney. &#8220;I
thought it was Juliet Mascarene there before me in
the sun, Juliet dead those years and years.&#8221; Then
commanding herself, and with one of those reverses,
sudden changes of manner and subject peculiar to
herself:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your luggage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Abraham is bringing it along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Abraham! Do you mean you didn&#8217;t drive,
<i>walked</i> here from the station?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Pinckney shamefacedly, almost, and
wondering what sin against the <i>covenances</i> he had
committed now.</p>
<p>&#8220;And she after that journey from N&#8217;York. Richard
Pinckney, you are a&mdash;man&mdash;I was going to have
called you a fool&mdash;but it&#8217;s the same thing. Here,
come on both of you&mdash;the child must be starving.
This is the breakfast room, Phyl&mdash;Phyl! I will
never get used to that name; no matter, I&#8217;m getting
an old woman, and mustn&#8217;t grumble&mdash;mustn&#8217;t grumble&mdash;umph!&#8221;</p>
<p>She took Pinckney&#8217;s walking-stick from him and,
with the end of it, picked up a duster that the mysterious
Dinah, evidently, had left lying on the floor.</p>
<p>She put the duster out on the veranda, rang a
bell and ordered the coloured boy who answered it
to send in breakfast.</p>
<p>Phyl, commanded by Miss Pinckney, sat down to
table just as she was without removing her hat.</p>
<p>The old lady had come to the conclusion that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
newcomer must be faint with hunger after her journey,
and when Miss Pinckney came to one of her conclusions,
there was nothing more to be said on the
matter.</p>
<p>It was a pleasant room, chintzy and sunny; they
sat down to a gate-legged table that would just manage
to seat four comfortably whilst the urn was
brought in, a copper urn in which the water was
kept at boiling point by a red hot iron contained in
a cylinder.</p>
<p>Phyl knew that urn. They had one like it at Kilgobbin
and she said so, but Miss Pinckney did not
seem to hear her. There were times when this lady
was almost rude&mdash;or seemed so owing to inattention,
her bustling mind often outrunning the conversation
or harking back to the past when it ought to have
been in the present.</p>
<p>Tea making, and the making of tea was a solemn
rite at Vernons, absorbed her whole attention, but
Pinckney noticed this morning that the hand, that
old, perfect, delicately shaped hand, trembled ever
so slightly as it measured the tea from the tortoise-shell
covered tea caddy, and that the thin lips, lips
whose thinness seemed only the result of the kisses
of Time, were moving as though debating some
question unheard.</p>
<p>He recognised that the coming of Phyl had produced
a great effect on Maria Pinckney. No one
knew her better than he, for no one loved her so
well.</p>
<p>It was she who ordered him about, still, just as
though he were a small boy, and sometimes as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
sat watching her, so fragile, so indomitable, like
the breath of winter would come the thought that a
day would come&mdash;a day might come soon when he
would be no longer ordered about, told to put his
hat in the hall&mdash;which is the proper place for hats&mdash;told
not to dare to bring cigars into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>To Phyl, Maria Pinckney formed part of the spell
that was surrounding her; Meeting Street had begun
the weaving of this spell, Vernons was completing it
with the aid of Maria Pinckney.</p>
<p>The song of the Cardinal Grosbeak in the garden,
the stirring of the window curtains in the warm
morning air, the feel of morning and sunlight, the
scent of the tea that was filling the room, the room
itself old-fashioned yet cheerful, chintzy and sunny,
all the things had the faint familiarity of the street.
It was as though the blood of her mother&#8217;s people
coursing in her veins had retained and brought to her
some thrill and warmth from all these things; these
things they knew and loved so well.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the carriage,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney,
whose ears had picked out the sound of it drawing
up at the front door. &#8220;They know where to take
the luggage. Richard, go and see that they don&#8217;t
knock the bannisters about. Abraham is all thumbs
and has no more sense in moving things than Dinah
has&#8217;n dusting them. Only last week when Mrs.
Beamis was going away, he let that trunk of hers
slip and I declare to goodness I thought it was a
church falling down the stairs and tearing the place
to pieces.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>There was little of the stately languor of the
South in Miss Pinckney&#8217;s speech. She was Northern
on the mother&#8217;s side. But in her prejudices she
was purely Southern, or, at least, Charlestonian.</p>
<p>Pinckney laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Phyl&#8217;s luggage will hurt much even
if it falls,&#8221; said he. &#8220;English luggage is generally
soft.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a trunk and a portmanteau,&#8221; said Phyl,
as he left the room, but Miss Pinckney did not seem
to hear; pouring herself out another cup of tea (she
was the best and the worst hostess in the whole
world) and seeming not to notice that Phyl&#8217;s cup
was empty, she was off on one of her mind wandering
expeditions, a state of soul that sometimes carried
her into the past, sometimes into the future,
that led her anywhere and to the wrapt, inward contemplation
of all sorts of things and subjects from
the doings of the Heavenly Host to the misdoings
of Dinah.</p>
<p>She talked on these expeditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sure and I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know what
folk want with the luggage they carry about with
them nowadays&mdash; The old folk didn&#8217;t. Not Saratoga
trunks, anyhow. I remember &#8217;swell as if it
was yesterday way back in 1880, when Richard&#8217;s
father and mother were married, old Simon Mascarene&mdash;he
belonged to your mother&#8217;s lot, the Mascarenes
of Virginia&mdash; He came to the wedding, and
all he brought was a carpet-bag. I can see the roses
on it still. He wore a beaver hat. They&#8217;d been
out of fashion for years and years. So was he.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
Twenty dollars apiece they cost him, and his clothes
were the same. Looked like a picture out of Dickens.
Your grandmother was there, too, came from
Richmond for the wedding, drove here in her own
carriage. She and Simon were the last of the Virginia
Mascarenes and they looked it. Seems to me
some people never can be new nor get away from
their ancestors. If you&#8217;d dressed Simon in kilts it
wouldn&#8217;t have made any difference, much, he&#8217;d still
have been Simon Mascarene of Virginia, just as stiff
and fine and proud and old-fashioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems funny that my people should have been
the Virginia Mascarenes,&#8221; said Phyl, &#8220;because&mdash;because&mdash;well,
I feel as if my people had always lived
here&mdash;this feels like home&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what it is,
but just as I came into the street outside there I
seemed to know it, and this house&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, God bless my soul,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney,
whose eyes had just fallen on the girl&#8217;s empty cup,
&#8220;here have I been talking and talking, and you waiting
for some more tea. Why didn&#8217;t you ask, child?&mdash;What
were you saying? The Virginia Mascarenes&mdash; Oh,
they often came here, and your mother
knew this house as well as Planters. That was the
name of their house in Richmond. But what I can&#8217;t
get over is your likeness to Juliet. She might have
been your sister to look at you both&mdash;and she dead
all these years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was Juliet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was the girl who died,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney.
&#8220;You know, although Richard calls me Aunt, I am
not really his aunt; it&#8217;s just an easy name for an old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
woman who is an interloper, a Pinckney adrift. It
was this way I came in. Long before the Civil
War, the Pinckneys lived at a house called Bures in
Legare Street. A fine old house it was, and is still.
Well, I was a cousin with a little money of my own,
and I was left lonely and they took me in. James
Pinckney was head of the family then, and he had
two sons, Rupert and Charles. I might have been
their sister the way we all lived together and loved
each other&mdash;and quarrelled. Dear me, dear me,
what is Time at all that it leaves everything the
same? The same sun, and flowers and houses, and
all the people gone or changed&mdash; Well, I am trying
to tell you&mdash; Rupert fell in love with Juliet
Mascarene, who lived here. He was killed suddenly
in &#8217;61&mdash; I don&#8217;t want to talk of it&mdash;and she
died of grief the year after. She died of grief&mdash;simply
died of grief. Charles lived and married in
1880 when he was forty years old. He married
Juliet&#8217;s brother&#8217;s daughter and Vernons came to him
on the marriage. He hadn&#8217;t a son till ten years
later. That son was Richard. Charles left Richard
all his property and Vernons on the condition
that I always lived here&mdash;till I died, and that&#8217;s how
it is. I&#8217;m not Richard&#8217;s aunt, it&#8217;s only a name
he gives me&mdash;I&#8217;m only just an old piece of furniture
left with the house to him. I&#8217;m so fond of
the place, it would kill me to leave it; places grow
like that round one, though I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know
why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder at you loving Vernons,&#8221; said
Phyl. &#8220;I was just the same about our place in Ireland,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
Kilgobbin&mdash;I thought it would kill me to leave
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about it,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney. Phyl
told, or tried to tell.</p>
<p>Looking back, she found between herself and Ireland
the sunlight of Charleston, the garden with the
magnolia trees where the red bird was singing and
the jessamine casting its perfume. Ireland looked
very far away and gloomy, desolate as Kilgobbin
without its master and with the mist of winter among
the trees.</p>
<p>All that was part of the Past gone forever, and
so great was the magic of this new place that she
found herself recognising with a little chill that this
Past had separated itself from her, that her feeling
towards it was faintly tinged by something not unlike
indifference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney, when she had finished,
&#8220;it must be a beautiful old place, though I can&#8217;t
seem to see it&mdash; You see, I&#8217;ve never been in Ireland
and I can&#8217;t picture it any more than the new
Jerusalem. Now Dinah knows all about the new
Jerusalem, from the golden slippers right up she sees
it&mdash;I can&#8217;t. Haven&#8217;t got the gift of seeing things,
and it seems strange that the A&#8217;mighty should
shower it on a coloured girl and leave a white woman
wanting; but it appears to be the A&#8217;mighty knows
his own business, so I don&#8217;t grumble. Now I&#8217;m
going to show you the house and your room. I&#8217;ve
given you a room looking right on the garden, this
side. You&#8217;ve noticed how all our houses here are
built with their sides facing the street and their fronts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
facing the garden, or maybe you haven&#8217;t noticed it
yet, but you will. &#8217;Pears to me our ancestors had
some sense in their heads, even though they didn&#8217;t
invent telegraphs to send bad news in a hurry and
railway cars to smash people to bits, and telephones
to let strangers talk right into one&#8217;s house just by
ringing a bell. Not that I&#8217;d let one into Vernons.
You may hunt high or low, garret or basement, you
won&#8217;t find one of those boxes of impudence in Vernons&mdash;not
while I have servants to go my messages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney was right. For years she had
fought the telephone and kept it out, making Richard
Pinckney&#8217;s life a tissue of small inconveniences,
and suffering this epitaph on her sanity to be written
by all sorts of inferior people, &#8220;Plumb crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>She led the way from the breakfast-room and
passed into the hall.</p>
<p>The spirit of Vernons inhabited the hall. One
might have fancied it as a stout and prosperous
gentleman attired in a blue coat with brass buttons,
shorts, and wearing a bunch of seals at his fob.
Oak, brought from England, formed the panelling,
and a great old grandfather&#8217;s clock, with the maker&#8217;s
name and address, &#8220;Whewel. Coggershall,&#8221; blazoned
on its brass face, told the time, just as it had told the
time when the Regent was ruling at St. James&#8217;s in
those days which seem so spacious, yet so trivial in
their pomp and vanity.</p>
<p>Sitting alone here of an afternoon with the sun
pointing fingers through the high leaded windows,
Whewel of Coggershall took you under his spell,
the spell of old ghosts of long forgotten afternoons,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
spacious afternoons filled with the cawing of rooks
and the drone of bees. English afternoons of the
good old time when the dust of the post chaise was
the only mark of hurry across miles of meadow land
and cowslip weather. And then as you sat held
by the sound of the slow-slipping seconds, maybe,
from some door leading to the servants&#8217; quarters
suddenly left open a voice would come, the voice of
some darky singing whilst at work.</p>
<p>A snatch of the South mixing with your dream of
England and the past, and making of the whole a
charm beyond words.</p>
<p>That is Charleston.</p>
<p>Set against the panelling and almost covering it
in parts were prints, wood-cuts, engravings, portraits
in black and white.</p>
<p>Here was a silhouette of Colonel Vernon, the
founder of the house, and another of his wife.
Here was an early portrait of Jeff Davis, hollow-cheeked
and goatee-bearded, and here was Mayflower,
the property of Colonel Seth Mascarene, the
fastest trotting horse in Virginia, worshipped by her
owner whose portrait hung alongside.</p>
<p>Phyl glanced at these pictures as she followed
Miss Pinckney, who opened doors shewing the dining-room,
a room rather heavily furnished, hung
with portraits of long-faced gentlemen and ladies of
old time, and then the drawing-room. A real drawing-room
of the Sixties, a thing preserved in its entirety,
in all its original stiffness, interesting as a
valentine, perfumed like an old rosewood cabinet.</p>
<p>Keepsakes and Books of Beauty lay on the centre
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
table, a gilt clock beneath a glass shade marked
the moment when it had ceased to keep time over
twenty-five years ago, the antimacassars on the armchairs
were not a line out of position; not a speck
of dust lay anywhere, and the Dresden shepherds
and shepherdesses simpered and made love in the
same old fashion, preserving unaltered the sentiment
of spring, the suggestion of Love, lambs, and
the song of birds.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as it used to be,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney.
&#8220;Nothing at all has been changed, and I dust it myself.
I would just as soon let a servant loose here
with a duster as I&#8217;d let one of the buzzards from
the market-place loose in the larder. Those water-colours
were done by Mary Mascarene, Juliet&#8217;s sister,
who died when she was fifteen; they mayn&#8217;t be
masterpieces but they&#8217;re Mary&#8217;s, and worth more&#8217;n
if they were covered with gold. Mrs. Beamis
sniffed when she came in here&mdash;she&#8217;s the woman
whose trunk got loose on the stairs I told you about&mdash;sniffed
as if the place smelt musty. She&#8217;s got a
husband who&#8217;s made a million dollars out of dry
goods in Chicago, and she thought the room wanted
re-furnishing. Didn&#8217;t say it, but I knew. A player-piano
is what she wanted. Didn&#8217;t say it, but <i>I</i> knew.
Umph!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney, having shown Phyl out, looked
round the room as if to make sure that all the familiar
ghosts were in their places, then she shut the
door with a snap, and turning, led the way upstairs
murmuring to herself, and with the exalted and far
away look which she wore when put out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>Phyl&#8217;s room lay on the first landing, a bright and
cheerful room papered with a rather cheap flower
and sprig patterned paper, spring-like for all its
cheapness, and just the background for children&#8217;s
heads when they wake up on a bright morning.</p>
<p>A bowl of flowers stood on the dressing-table,
and the open window shewed across the verandah a
bit of the garden, where the cherokee roses were
blooming.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is your room,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney. &#8220;It&#8217;s
one of the brightest in the house, and I hope you&#8217;ll
like it&mdash; Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>Through the open window came the chime of
church-bells.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the chimes of St. Michael&#8217;s. You&#8217;ll never
want a clock here, the bells ring every quarter, just
as they&#8217;ve rung for the last hundred years; they&#8217;re
the first thing I remember, and maybe they&#8217;ll be the
last. Well, come on and I&#8217;ll show you some more
of the house, if you&#8217;re not tired and don&#8217;t want to
rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>She led the way from the room and along the corridor,
opening doors and shewing rooms, and then
up a back stairs to the top floor beneath the attics.</p>
<p>The house seemed to grow in age as they ascended.
Not a door in Vernons was exactly true in line; the
old house settling itself down quietly through the
years and assisted perhaps by the great earthquake,
though that had left it practically unharmed, shewed
that deviation from the right line in cornice and
wainscoting and door space, which is the hall mark
left on architecture by genius or age. The builders
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
of the Parthenon knew this, the builders of Vernons
did not&mdash; Age supplied their defects.</p>
<p>Up here the flooring of the passages and rooms
frankly sagged in places, and the beams bellied downwards
ever so little and the ceilings bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen all these bed-rooms filled in the old
days,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney. &#8220;We had wounded soldiers
here in the war. What Vernons hasn&#8217;t seen of
American history isn&#8217;t worth telling&mdash;much. Here&#8217;s
the nursery.&#8221;</p>
<p>She opened a door with bottle-glass panels, real
old bottle-glass worth its weight in minted silver,
and shewed Phyl into a room.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the nursery,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>It was a large room with two windows, and the
windows were barred to keep small people from tumbling
into the garden. The place had the air of
silence and secrecy that haunts rooms long closed and
deserted. An old-fashioned paper shewing birds of
Paradise covered the walls. A paper so old that
Miss Pinckney remembered it when, as a child, she
had come here to tea with the Mascarene children,
so good that the dye of the gorgeous Paradise birds
had scarcely faded.</p>
<p>A beam of morning sun struck across the room, a
great solid, golden bar of light. Phyl, as she stood
for a moment on the threshold, saw motes dancing
in the bar of light; the air was close and almost
stuffy owing to the windows being shut. A rocking-horse,
much, much the worse for wear stood in one
corner, he was piebald and the beam of light just
failed to touch his brush-like tail. A Noah&#8217;s Ark
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
of the good old pattern stood on the lid of a great
chest under one of the windows, and in the centre
of the room a heavy table of plain oak nicked by
knives and stained with ink told its tale.</p>
<p>There were books in a little hanging book-case,
books of the &#8216;forties&#8217; and &#8216;fifties&#8217;: &#8220;Peter Parley,&#8221;
&#8220;The Child&#8217;s Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress,&#8221; &#8220;The Dairy-Maid&#8217;s
Daughter,&#8221; an odd volume of <i>Harper&#8217;s</i>
<i>Magazine</i> containing an instalment of &#8220;Little Dorrit,&#8221;
Caroline Chesebro&#8217;s &#8220;Children of Light,&#8221; and
Samuel Irenæus Prime&#8217;s &#8220;Elizabeth Thornton or
the Flower and Fruit of Female Piety, and other
Sketches.&#8221; Miss Pinckney opened one of the windows
to let in air; Phyl, who had said nothing, stood
looking about her at the forsaken toys, the chairs,
and the little three-legged stool most evidently once
the property of some child.</p>
<p>All nurseries have a generic likeness. It seemed
to her that she knew this room, from the beam of
light with the motes dancing in it to the bird-patterned
paper. Kilgobbin nursery was papered with
a paper giving an endless repetition of one subject&mdash;a
man driving a pig to market&mdash;with that exception,
the two rooms were not unlike. Yet those birds
were the haunting charm of this place, the things that
most appealed to her, things that seemed the ghosts
of old friends.</p>
<p>She came to the window and looked out through
the bars. Across the garden of Vernons one caught
a glimpse of other gardens, palmetto-tree tops, and
away, beyond the battery, a hint of the blue harbour.
Just the picture to fill an imaginative child&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
mind with all sorts of pleasant fancies about the
world, and Phyl, forgetting for a moment Miss
Pinckney, herself, and the room in which she was,
stood looking out, caught in a momentary day dream,
just like a child in one of those reveries that are part
of the fairy tale of childhood.</p>
<p>That touch of blue sea beyond the red roofs and
green palmetto fronds gave her mind wings for a
moment and a world to fly through. Not the world
we live in, but the world worth living in. Old sailor-stories,
old scraps of thought and dreams from nowhere
pursued her, haunted her during that delightful
and tantalising moment, and then she was herself
again and Miss Pinckney was saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty view and hasn&#8217;t changed since I was
a child. Now, in N&#8217;York they&#8217;d have put up skyscrapers;
Lord bless you, they&#8217;d have put them up
at a <i>loss</i> so&#8217;s to seem energetic and spoil the view.
That&#8217;s a N&#8217;Yorker in two words, happy so long as
he&#8217;s energetic and spoiling views&mdash;&#8221; Then gazing
dreamily towards the touch of blue sea. &#8220;Well, I
guess the Lord made N&#8217;Yorkers same as he made
you and me. His ways are <i>in</i>scrutable and past finding
out; so&#8217;r the ways of some of his creatures.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned from the window, and her eye fell on
the great chest by the other window.</p>
<p>Going to it, she opened the lid.</p>
<p>It was full of old toys, mostly broken. She
seemed to have forgotten the presence of Phyl.
Holding the chest&#8217;s lid open, she gazed at the coloured
and futile contents.</p>
<p>Then she closed the lid of the chest with a sigh.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p>The South dines at four o&#8217;clock&mdash;at least
Charleston does.</p>
<p>It was the old English custom and the old Irish
custom, too.</p>
<p>In the reign of William the Conqueror people
dined at eleven <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>a.m.</span> or was it ten? Then, as
civilisation advanced, the dinner hour stole forward.
In the time of the Georges it reached four
o&#8217;clock. In Ireland, the most conservative country
on earth, some people even still sit down to table at
four&mdash;in Charleston every one does.</p>
<p>One would not change the custom for worlds,
just as one would not change the old box pews of
St. Michael&#8217;s or replace the cannon on the Battery
with modern ordinance.</p>
<p>Richard Pinckney did not dine at home that day.
He was dining with the Rhetts in Calhoun Street,
so Miss Pinckney said as they sat down to table.
She sniffed as she said it, for the Rhetts, though
one of the best families in the town, were people
not of her way of thinking. The two Rhett girls
had each a motor-car of her own and drove it&mdash;abomination!</p>
<p>The automobile ranked in her mind with the telephone
as an invention of the devil.</p>
<p>Phyl had not seen Richard Pinckney since the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
morning and now he was dining out. Her heart
had warmed to him at the station on the way to
Vernons, and at breakfast he had appeared to her
as a quite different person to the Richard Pinckney
who had come to Kilgobbin, more boyish and frank,
less of a man of the world. She had not seen him
since he left the room at breakfast-time to look after
her luggage. Miss Pinckney said he had gone off
&#8220;somewhere or another&#8221; and grumbled at him for
going off leaving his breakfast not quite finished,
she said that he was always &#8220;scatter braining about&#8221;
either at the yacht club or somewhere else.</p>
<p>Phyl, as she sat now at the dining-table with the
dead and gone Mascarene men and women looking
at her from the canvases on the wall, felt ever so
slightly hurt.</p>
<p>Youth calls to youth irrespective of sex. She
felt as a young person feels when another young
person shows indifference. Then came the thought:
was he avoiding her? Was he angry still about
the affair at Kilgobbin, or was it just that he did not
want to be bothered talking to her, looked on her
as a nuisance in the house, a guest of no interest to
him and yet to whom he had to be polite?</p>
<p>She could not tell. Neither could she tell why
the problem exercised her mind in the way it did.
Even at Kilgobbin, despite the fact of her antagonism
towards him, Pinckney had possessed the
power of disturbing her mind and making her think
about him in a way that no one else had ever succeeded
in doing. No one else had made her feel
the short-comings in the household <i>ménage</i> at Kilgobbin,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
no one else had made her so fiercely critical
of herself and her belongings.</p>
<p>She did not recognise the fact, but the fact was
there, that it was a necessity of her being to stand
well in this man&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>When a woman falls in love with a man or a man
with a woman, the first necessity of his or her being
is to stand well in the eyes of the loved one, anything
that may bring ridicule or adverse criticism or
disdain is death.</p>
<p>Phyl was not in love with Richard Pinckney, nor
had she been in love with him at Kilgobbin, all the
same the sensitiveness to appearances felt by a lover
was there. Her anger that night when he had let
her in at eleven o&#8217;clock was due, perhaps, less to his
implied reproof then the fact that she had felt
cheap in his eyes, and now, sitting at dinner with
Miss Pinckney the idea that he was still angry with
her was obscured by the far more distasteful idea
that she was of absolutely no account in his eyes,
a creature to whom he had to be civil, an interloper.</p>
<p>Her cheeks flushed and her eyes brightened at
the thought, but Miss Pinckney did not notice it.
She had turned from the subject of the Rhetts
and their automobiles to Charleston society in general.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that you&#8217;ve come,&#8221; said she, &#8220;you will find
there&#8217;s not a moment you won&#8217;t enjoy yourself if
you&#8217;re fond of gadding about. All the society here
is in the hands of young people, balls and parties!
The St. Cecilias give three balls a year. I go always,
not to dance but to look on. Richard is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
St. Cecilia&mdash;St. Cecilias? Why, it&#8217;s just a club a
hundred-and-forty years old. There are two hundred
of them, all men, and they know how to entertain.
I have been at every ball for the last half
century. Not one have I missed. Then there&#8217;s the
yacht club and picnics to Summerville and the Isle
of Palms, and bathing parties and boating by moonlight.
If you are a gad-about you will enjoy all
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not,&#8221; said Phyl. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been used
to society, much. I like books better than people,
unless they&#8217;re&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless they&#8217;re what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;people I really like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney, &#8220;one wouldn&#8217;t expect
you to like people you <i>didn&#8217;t</i> like&mdash;there&#8217;s no
&#8216;really&#8217; in liking, it&#8217;s one thing or the other&mdash;you
don&#8217;t care for girls, maybe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen much of them,&#8221; replied Phyl,
&#8220;except at school, and that was only for a short
time. I&mdash;I ran away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ran away! And why did you run away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was miserable; they were kind enough to me,
but I wanted to get home&mdash;Father was alive then&mdash;I
felt I had to get home or die&mdash;I can&#8217;t explain it&mdash;It
felt like a sort of madness. I had to get back
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney was watching the girl, she scarcely
seemed listening to her&mdash;Then she spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;Impulsive. If I wasn&#8217;t sitting here in broad
daylight, I&#8217;d fancy it was Juliet Mascarene. What
makes you so like her? It&#8217;s not the face so much,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
though the family likeness runs strong, still, the
face is different, though like&mdash;It&#8217;s just you yourself&mdash;well,
I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know, seems to me there&#8217;s
a lot of things hid from us. Look at the Pringles,
Anthony&#8217;s family, the ones that live in Tradd
Street. If you put their noses together, they&#8217;d
reach to Legare Street. It runs in the family.
Julian Pringle, he died in &#8217;70, he was just the same.
Now why should a long nose run through a family
like that, or a bad temper, or the colour of hair?
I don&#8217;t know. The world&#8217;s a puzzle and the older
one grows, the more it puzzles one.&#8221;</p>
<p>After dinner, Miss Pinckney ordered Phyl to put
on her hat and they started out for a drive.</p>
<p>Every day at five o&#8217;clock, weather permitting,
Miss Pinckney took an airing. She was one of the
sights of Charleston, she, and the dark chestnut
horses driven by Abraham the coloured coachman,
and the barouche in which she drove; a carriage of
other times, one of those deathless conveyances
turned out in Long Acre in the days when varnish
was varnish and hand labour had not been ousted
by machinery. It was painted in a basket-work pattern,
the pattern peculiar to the English Royal carriages,
and the whole turn-out had an excellence and
a style of its own&mdash;a thing unpurchasable as yesterday.</p>
<p>They drove in the direction of the Battery and
here they drew up to look at the view. On one side
of them stood the great curving row of mansions
facing the sea, old Georgian houses and houses
more modern, yet without offence, set in gardens
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
where the palmetto leaves shivered in the sea wind
and the pink mimosa mixed its perfume with the
salt-scented air. On the other side lay the sea.
Afternoon, late afternoon, is the time of all times
to visit this spacious and sunlit place. It is then
that the old ghosts return, if ever they return, to
discuss the news brought by the last packet from
England, the doings of Mr. Pitt, the Paris fashions.</p>
<p>Looking seaward they would see no change in
the changeless sea and little change in the city if
they turned their eyes that way.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney got out and they walked a bit, inspecting
the guns, each with its brass plate and its
story.</p>
<p>Far away in the haze stood Fort Sumter,&mdash;a
fragment of history, a sea warrior of the past,
voiceless and guarding forever the viewless. It
may have been some recollection of the Brighton
front and of the great harbour of Kingstown with
the sun upon it, and all this seemed vaguely familiar
to Phyl, pleasantly familiar and homely.
She breathed the sea air deeply and then, as she
turned, glancing towards the land, a recollection
came to her of the story she had been reading that
evening in the library at Kilgobbin&mdash;&#8220;The Gold
Bug.&#8221; It was near here that Legrand had found
the treasure. He had come to Charleston to buy
the mattocks and picks&mdash;no, it was Jupp the negro
who had come to buy them.</p>
<p>She turned to Miss Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever read a story called &#8216;The Gold
Bug&#8217; by Edgar Allan Poe?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;It is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
about a place near here&mdash;Sullivan&#8217;s Island&mdash;that&#8217;s
it&mdash;I remember now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I knew him,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knew Edgar Allan Poe!&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew him when I was a child and I have sat
on his knee and I can see his face&mdash;what a face it
was! and the coat he wore&mdash;it had a velvet collar&mdash;his
teeth were beautiful, and his hair&mdash;beautiful
glossy hair it was, but he was not handsome as people
use that expression, he was extraordinary, such
eyes&mdash;and the most wonderful voice in the world.
I&#8217;m seventy-five years of age and he died in October
&#8217;49, and I met him three years before he died, so
you see I was a pretty small child. It was at Fordham.
He&#8217;d just taken a cottage there for his wife,
who was ailing with consumption, and my aunt,
Mary Pinckney, who was a friend of the Osgoods,
took me there. It must have been summer for I
remember a bird hanging in a cage in the sunshine,
a bob-o&#8217;-link it was, he had caught it in the woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Lord! I wonder where that summer
day&#8217;s gone to, and the bob-o&#8217;-link&mdash;&#8217;pears to me we
aren&#8217;t even memories, for memories live and we
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were walking along, Abraham slowly following
with the carriage, and Miss Pinckney was
walking in an exultant manner as though she saw
nothing about her, as though she were treading air.
Phyl had unconsciously set free a train of thought
in the mind of Miss Pinckney, a train that always
led to an explosion, and this is exactly how it happened
and what she said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But his memory will live. Look right round
you, do you see his statue?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Phyl, sweeping the view. &#8220;Where is
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so, where is it? It&#8217;s not here, it&#8217;s not in
N&#8217;York, it&#8217;s not in Baltimore, it&#8217;s not in Philadelphia,
it&#8217;s not in Boston. The one real splendid
writing man that America has produced she&#8217;s
ashamed to put up a statue to. Why? Because
he drank! Why, God bless my soul, Grant drank.
No, it wasn&#8217;t drink, it was Griswold. The man
who hated him, the man who crucified his reputation
and sold the remains for thirty pieces of silver to a
publisher, Griswold, Rufus Griswold&mdash;Judas Griswold
that was his real name, and he hid it&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney had lowered her parasol in her
anger, she shut it with a snap and then shot it up
again; as she did so an automobile driven by a girl
and which was approaching them, passed, and a
young man seated by the girl raised his hat.</p>
<p>It was Richard Pinckney.</p>
<p>The girl was a very pretty brunette. This thing
was too much for Miss Pinckney in her present
temper; all her anger against Griswold seemed suddenly
diverted to the automobile. She snorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;There goes Richard with Venetia Frances
Rhett,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Ought to be ashamed of herself
driving along the Battery in that outrageous
thing; goodness knows, they&#8217;re bad enough driven
by men, scaring people to death and killing dogs and
chickens, without girls taking to them&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She stared after the car, then signalling to Abraham,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
she got into the barouche, Phyl followed her
and they continued their drive.</p>
<p>That evening after supper Miss Pinckney&#8217;s mind
warmed to thoughts of the good old days when
motor-cars were undreamed of, and stirred up by the
recollection of Edgar Allan Poe, discharged itself
of reminiscences worth much gold could they have
been taken down by a stenographer.</p>
<p>She was sitting with Phyl in the piazza, for the
night was warm, and whilst a big southern moon lit
the garden, she let her mind stray over the men
and women who had made American literature in
the &#8217;50&#8217;s and &#8217;60&#8217;s, many of whom she had known
when young.</p>
<p>Estelle Anna Lewis of Baltimore, Nathaniel
Hawthorne, William Cullen Bryant, Elizabeth
Oakes Smith, Cornelius Mathews, Frances Sargent
Osgood, N. P. Willis, Laughton Osborn. She had
known Lowell and Longfellow, yet her mind
seemed to cling mostly to the lesser people, writers
in the <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>, the <i>Home Journal</i>, the <i>Mirror</i> and the <i>Broadway Journal</i>.</p>
<p>People well-known in their day and now scarcely
remembered, yet whose very names are capable of
evoking the colour and romance of that fascinating
epoch beyond and around the Civil War.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all dead and gone,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and folk
nowadays don&#8217;t seem to trouble about the best of
them, or remember their lines, yet there&#8217;s nothing
they write now that&#8217;s as good&mdash;I remember poor
Thomas Ward. &#8216;Flaccus&#8217; was the name he wrote
under, a thin skeleton of a man always with his head
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
in the air and his mind somewhere else, used to
write in the <i>Knickerbocker Journal</i>; I heard him
recite one of his things.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;And, straining, fastened on her lips a kiss,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>That seemed to suck the life blood from her heart.&#8217;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;That stuck in my head, mostly, I expect, because
Thomas Ward didn&#8217;t look as if he&#8217;d ever kissed a
girl, but they are good lines and a lot better than
they write nowadays.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wind had risen a bit and was stirring in the
leaves of the magnolias, white carnations growing
near the sun dial shook their ruffles in the moonlight,
and from near and far away came the sounds
of Charleston, voices, the sound of traffic and then,
a thread of tune tying moonbeams, magnolias, carnations
and cherokee roses in a great southern
bunch, came the notes of a banjo, plunk, plunk, and
a voice from somewhere away in the back premises,
the voice of a negro singing one of the old Plantation
songs.</p>
<p>Just a snatch before some closing door cut the
singer off, but enough to make Phyl raise her head
and listen, listen as though a whole world vaguely
guessed, a world forgotten yet still warm and loving,
youthful and sunlit, were striving to reach her and
speak to her&mdash;As though Charleston the mysterious
city that had greeted her first in Meeting Street
were trying to tell her of things delightful, once
loved, once known and forever vanished.</p>
<p>As she lay awake that night with the moonlight
showing through the blinds, the whole of that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
strange day came before her in pictures: the face of
Frances Rhett troubled her, yet she did not know in
the least why; it seemed part of the horribleness of
automobiles and the anger of Miss Pinckney and
the tribulations of Edgar Allan Poe.</p>
<p>Then the fantastic band of forgotten <i>literati</i>
trooped before her, led by &#8220;Flaccus,&#8221; the man who
didn&#8217;t look as if he had ever kissed a girl, yet who
wrote:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p>Phyl awoke to the early morning sunlight and
the sounds of Charleston.</p>
<p>The chimes of St. Michael&#8217;s were striking six and
through the summery sunlit air carried by the sea
wind stirring the curtains came the cries of the
streets and the rumbling of early morning carts.</p>
<p>Oh, those negro cries! the cry of the crab-seller,
the orange vendor, the man who sells &#8220;monkey
meat&#8221; dolorous, long drawn out, lazy, you do not
know the South till you have heard them.</p>
<p>The sound of a mat being shaken and beaten on
the piazza, adjoining that on which her window
opened came now, and two voices in dispute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mistress Pinckney she told me to tell you&mdash;she
mos&#8217; sholey did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go wash yo&#8217; face, yo&#8217; coloured trash, cummin&#8217;
here wid yo&#8217; orders&mdash;skip out o&#8217; my piazza&mdash;&#8217;clar&#8217;
to goodness I dunno what&#8217;s cummin&#8217; to niggers dese
days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Miss Pinckney&#8217;s voice as from an upper
window:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinah! Seth! what&#8217;s that I hear? Get on
with your work the pair of you and stop your chattering.
You hear me?&#8221;</p>
<p>When Phyl came down Richard Pinckney was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
the garden smoking a cigarette and gathering some
carnations.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re for aunt,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to propitiate her
for my being late last night. I wasn&#8217;t in till one.
I&#8217;m worse even than you, you see, and the next time
you are out till eleven and I let you in and grumble
at you, you can hit back. Have a flower.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave her the finest in his bunch and Phyl put
it in her belt. If she had any doubt as to the sincerity
of his welcome his manner this morning ought
to have set her mind at rest.</p>
<p>She stood looking at him as he tied the stalks of
the flowers together and he was worth looking at,
a fresh, bright figure, the very incarnation of youth
and health and one might almost say innocence.
Clear eyed, well-groomed, good to look upon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I generally pick a flower and put it on her
plate,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but this morning she shall have a
whole bunch&mdash;hope you slept all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather,&#8221; said Phyl, &#8220;I never sleep much the first
night in a new place&mdash;but somehow&mdash;oh, I don&#8217;t
know how to express it&mdash;but nothing here seems
new.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is,&#8221; said he laughing, &#8220;it&#8217;s all as old as
the hills&mdash;you like it, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a question of liking&mdash;of course I like it,
who could help liking it&mdash;it&#8217;s more than that. It&#8217;s
a feeling I have that I will either love it or hate it,
and I don&#8217;t know which yet, all sorts of things come
back to me here, you see, my mother knew the place&mdash;do
people remember what their mothers and
fathers knew, I wonder? But, if you understood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
me, it&#8217;s not so much remembering as feeling. All
yesterday it seemed to me that I had only to turn
some corner and come upon something waiting for
me, something I knew quite well, and the smells and
sounds and things are always reminding me of
something&mdash;you know how it is when you have forgotten
a name and when it&#8217;s lying just at the back of
your mind&mdash;that&#8217;s how I feel here, about nearly
everything&mdash;strange, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said the practical Pinckney.
&#8220;This place is awfully English for one thing, sure
to remind you of a lot of things in Ireland and England,
and then there&#8217;s of course the fact that you
are partly American, but I don&#8217;t see why you should
ever hate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Indeed</i>, I didn&#8217;t mean that,&#8221; said she flushing
up at the thought that in trying to express herself
she had made such a blunder. &#8220;I meant&mdash;I meant,
that this something about the place that is always
reminding me of itself might make me hate <i>it</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or love it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I can&#8217;t explain&mdash;the place itself no one
could hate, you must have thought me rude.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit&mdash;not the least little bit in the world.
Well, I believe you&#8217;ll come to love it, not hate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It,&#8221; said Phyl. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know that, because I
don&#8217;t know what it is&mdash;this something that is always
peeping round corners at me yet hiding itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Richard</i>!&#8221; came Miss Pinckney&#8217;s voice from the
piazza where she had just appeared, &#8220;smoking
cigarettes before breakfast, how often have I told
you I won&#8217;t have you smoking before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
breakfast&mdash;why, God bless my soul, what are you doing with
all those carnations?&#8221;</p>
<p>He flung the cigarette-end away, but she refused
to kiss him on account of the tobacco fumes, though
she took the flowers.</p>
<p>Cigarettes, like telephones, automobiles, and the
memory of Edgar Allan Poe, formed a subject upon
which once started Miss Pinckney was hard to
check, and whilst she poured out the tea, she pursued
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Cotton it was who told me, the one who
used to live in Tradd Street, he was a relative of
Dr. Garden the man that gave his name to that
flower they call the gardenia&mdash;had it sent him from
somewhere in the South, but I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know
where&mdash;New Orleans, I think, but it doesn&#8217;t matter.
I was saying about Dr. Cotton, <i>old</i> Dr. Cotton of
Tradd Street, he told me that the truth about young
William Pringle&#8217;s death was that he was black when
he died, from cigarette smoking, black as a crow.
Used to smoke before breakfast, used to smoke all
day, used to smoke in his sleep, I b&#8217;lieve. Couldn&#8217;t
get rid of the pesky habit and died clinging to it,
black as a crow. I can&#8217;t abide the things. Your
father used to smoke Bull Durham in a corn cob,
or a cigar, he&#8217;d a&#8217; soon have smoked one of those
cigarettes of yours as soon as he&#8217;d have been caught
doing tatting. Don&#8217;t tell me, there&#8217;s no manhood
in them, it&#8217;s just vice in thimble-fulls. I&#8217;d much
sooner see a man lying healthily under the table
once in a way than always half fuddled, and I&#8217;d
sooner be poisoned out by a green cigar now and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
then, than always having that nasty sickly cigarette
smell round the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But good gracious, Aunt, I&#8217;m not a cigarette
smoker, only once and away and at odd times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t talking about you so much as the young
men of to-day, and the young women, they&#8217;re the
worst, for they encourage the others to make fools
of themselves, and if they&#8217;re not smoking themselves
they&#8217;re sucking candy. Candy sucking and
cigarette smoking is the ruin of the States. Those
Rhett girls <i>live</i> on candy, and they look it&mdash;pasty
faces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; said he, &#8220;what grudge have you got
against the Rhetts now, Aunt&mdash;it&#8217;s as bad to take a
girl&#8217;s complexion away as a man&#8217;s character&mdash;what
have the Rhetts been doing to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney did not seem to hear the question
for a moment, then she said, speaking as if to some
invisible person:</p>
<p>&#8220;That Frances Rhett may be reckoned the belle
of Charleston, that&#8217;s what I heard old Mr. Outhwaite
call her, but she&#8217;s a belle I wouldn&#8217;t care to
have tied round my neck. Belle! She&#8217;s no more a
belle than I am, there are hundreds of prettier girls
between here and the Battery, but she&#8217;s one of those
sort that have the knack of setting young men
against each other and making them fight for her;
she&#8217;s labelled herself as a prize, which she isn&#8217;t. I
declare to goodness the world frightens me at times,
the way I see fools going about labelled as clever
men, and women your grandfathers wouldn&#8217;t have
cast an eye at going about labelled as beauties. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
do believe if I was to give myself out as a beauty
to-morrow I&#8217;d have half the young idiots in Charleston
after me, believing me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re after you already,&#8221; said Pinckney,
&#8220;only yesterday I heard young Reggy Calhoun saying&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney, &#8220;and I want no
more of your impudence. Now take yourself off if
you&#8217;ve finished your breakfast, for Phyl and I have
work to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>He got up and went off laughing by way of the
piazza and they could hear his cheery voice in the
garden talking to the old negro gardener.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney&#8217;s eyes softened. She was fiddling
with a spoon and when she spoke she seemed speaking
to it, turning it about as if to examine its pattern
all the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what mothers with boys feel like,
but I do want to see that boy safe and married before
I go. He&#8217;s just the sort to be landed in unhappiness;
he is, most surely; well, I don&#8217;t know,
there&#8217;s no use in warning young folk, you may spank
&#8217;em for stealing the jam but you can&#8217;t spank &#8217;em
from fooling with the wrong sort of girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney had talked the night before of
Phyl&#8217;s father and had proposed taking her this
morning to the Magnolia cemetery to see the grave.
She broke off the conversation suddenly as this fact
strayed into her mind, and, rising up, invited Phyl
to follow her to the kitchen premises where she had
orders to give before starting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always look after my own house,&#8221; said she,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
&#8220;and always will. Fine ladies nowadays sit in their
drawing-rooms and ring their bells for the servants
to rob them and they aren&#8217;t any more respected.
That&#8217;s what makes the Charleston negro the impudentest
lump of blackness under the sun, that and
knowing they&#8217;re emancipated. They&#8217;ve got to look
on themselves as part of the Heavenly Host. Well,
I&#8217;ll have no emancipated rubbish in my house, and
the consequence is I never lose a servant and I never
get impudence. They&#8217;ll all get a pension when
they&#8217;re too old to work, and good food and good
pay whilst they&#8217;re working, and I&#8217;ve said to them
&#8216;you&#8217;re no more emancipated than I am, we&#8217;re all
slaves to our duty and the only difference between
now and the old days is I can&#8217;t sell you&mdash;and if you
were idle enough to make me want to sell you
there&#8217;s no one would buy such rubbish nowadays.&#8217;
Half the trouble is that people these times don&#8217;t
know how to talk to coloured folk, and the other
half is that they don&#8217;t want to talk to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>She led the way down passages to the great
kitchen, stonebuilt, clean and full of sunlight. The
door was open on to the yard and through an open
side door one could get a glimpse of the scullery,
the great washing up sink, generations old, and
worn with use, and above it the drying dresser.</p>
<p>There were no new-fangled cooking inventions
at Vernons, everything was done at an open range
of the good old fashion still to be found in many an
English country house.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney objected to &#8220;baked meat&#8221; and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
joints at Vernons were roast, swinging from a clockwork
Jack and basted all the time with a long metal
ladle.</p>
<p>By the range this morning was seated an old
coloured woman engaged in cutting up onions.
This was Prue the oldest living thing in Vernons
and perhaps in Charleston; she had been kitchen
maid before Miss Pinckney was born, then cook,
and now, long past work, she was just kept on.
Twenty-five years ago she had been offered a pension
and a cottage for herself but she refused both.
She wanted to die where she was, so she said. So
they let her stay, doing odd jobs and bossing the
others just as though she were still mistress of the
kitchen&mdash;as in fact she was. She had become a
legend and no one knew her exact age, she was
creepin&#8217; close to a hundred, and her memory which
carried her back to the slave days was marvellous
in its retentiveness.</p>
<p>She had cooked a dinner for Jeff Davis when he
was a guest at Vernons, she could still hear the guns
of the Civil War, so she said, and the Mascarene
family history was her Bible.</p>
<p>She looked down on the Pinckneys as trash beside
the Mascarenes, and interlopers, and this attitude
and point of view though well known to Miss Pinckney
was not in the least resented by her.</p>
<p>But during the last few years this old lady&#8217;s intellect
had been steadily coming under eclipse; still
insisting on doing little jobs in a futile sort of way,
silence had been creeping upon her so that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
rarely spoke now, and when she did, by chance, her
words revealed the fact that her mind was dwelling
in the past.</p>
<p>Rachel, the cook, a sturdy coloured woman with
her head bound up in an isabelle-coloured handkerchief
was standing by the kitchen table on which she
was resting the fore-finger of her left hand, whilst
with the right she was turning over some fish that
had just been sent in from the fishmonger&#8217;s. She
seemed in a critical mood, but what she said to Miss
Pinckney was lost to Phyl whose attention was attracted
by a chuckling sound from near the range.</p>
<p>It was Prue.</p>
<p>The old woman at sight of Phyl had dropped the
knife and the onion on which she had been engaged.
She was now seated, hands on knees, chuckling and
nodding to the girl, then, scarcely raising her right
hand from her knee, she made a twiddling movement
with the fore-finger as if to say, &#8220;come here&mdash;come
here&mdash;I have something to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl glanced at Miss Pinckney who was so taken
up with what Rachel was saying about the fish that
she noticed nothing. Then she looked again at
Prue and, unable to resist the invitation, came towards
her. The old woman caught her by the arm
so that she had to bend her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Julie,&#8221; whispered Prue, &#8220;Massa Pinckney
told me tell yo&#8217; he be at de gate t&#8217;night same time
&#8217;slas&#8217; night. Done you let on &#8217;s I told yo&#8217;,&#8221; she gave
the arm a pinch and relapsed into herself chuckling
whilst Phyl stood with a little shiver, half of relief
at her escape from that bony clutch, half of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
dread&mdash;a vague dread as though she had come in contact
with something uncanny.</p>
<p>She came to the table again and stood without
looking at Prue, whilst Miss Pinckney completed
her orders, then, that lady, having finished her business
and casting an eye about the place on the
chance of finding any dirt or litter, saw Prue and
asked how she was doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, miss, she&#8217;s doin&#8217; fa&#8217;r,&#8221; replied Rachel,
&#8220;but I&#8217;m t&#8217;inking she&#8217;s not long fore de new Jerusalem.
Sits didderin&#8217; dere &#8217;n&#8217; smokin&#8217; her pipe, &#8217;n&#8217;
lays about her wid her stick times, fancyin&#8217; there&#8217;er
dogs comin&#8217; into de kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A dog bit her once way back in the &#8217;60&#8217;s,&#8221; said
Miss Pinckney; &#8220;they used to keep dogs here then.
She don&#8217;t want for anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Law no, miss, <i>she</i> done want for nothin&#8217;; look
at her now laffin&#8217; to herself. Haven&#8217;t seen her do
that way dis long time. Hi, Prue, what yo&#8217; laffin&#8217;
at?&#8221;</p>
<p>Prue, instead of answering leant further forward
hiding her face without checking her merriment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crazy,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney, &#8220;but it&#8217;s better to
be laughing crazy than crying crazy like some folk&mdash;here&#8217;s
a quarter and get her some candy.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put the coin on the table and marched off
followed by Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;She wanted to tell me something,&#8221; said Phyl as
they were driving to the cemetery; &#8220;she beckoned
me to her and took hold of my arm and whispered
something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did she say?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>Phyl, somehow, could not bring herself to betray
that crazy confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, exactly, but she called me Miss
Julie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;she called you Miss Julie,&#8221; said the other.
Then she relapsed into thought and nothing more
was said till they reached their destination.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p>Charleston&#8217;s Magnolia Cemetery like
everything else about Charleston shows the
touch of the War. Here the soldiers lie who
fought so bravely under Wade Hampton and here
lies the general himself.</p>
<p>Go south, go north, and you will not find a place
touched by the War where you will not find noble
memories, echoes of heroic deeds, legends of brave
men.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney was by no means a peace party
and this thought was doubtless in her head as she
stood surveying the confederate graves. There
were relations here and men whom she had known
as a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the War,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and people abuse
war as if it was the worst thing in the world, insulting
the dead. &#8217;Clare to goodness it makes me
savage to hear the pasty-faces talking of war and
making plans to abolish it. It&#8217;s like hearing a lot
of children making plans to abolish thunder storms.
Where would America be now without the War,
and where&#8217;d her history be? You tell me that.
It&#8217;d just be the history of a big canning factory.
These men aren&#8217;t dead, they&#8217;re still alive and fighting&mdash;fighting
Chicago; fighting pork, and wheat,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
and cotton and railway-stock and everything else
that&#8217;s abolishing the soul of the nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Matt Carey&#8217;s grave. He had everything
he wanted, and he wasn&#8217;t young. Now-a-days
he&#8217;d have been driving in his automobile killing
old women and chickens, or tarpoon fishing
down &#8217;n Florida letting the world go rip, or full of
neur&mdash;what do they call it&mdash;that thing that gets on
their nerves and makes crazy old men of them at
forty&mdash;I&#8217;ve forgotten. <i>He</i> didn&#8217;t. He took up a
gun and died like a lion, and he was a middle-aged
business man. No one remembers him, I do believe,
except, maybe me, clean forgotten&mdash;and yet
he helped to put a brick into the only monument
worth ten cents that America has got&mdash;The War.</p>
<p>&#8220;And some northern people would say &#8216;nice sort
of brick, seeing he was fighting on the wrong side.&#8217;
Wrong side or right side he was fighting for something
else than his own hand. <i>That&#8217;s</i> the point.&#8221;</p>
<p>She closed up her lips and they went on. Phyl
found her father&#8217;s grave in a quiet spot where the
live-oaks stood, the long grey moss hanging from
their branches.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney, having pointed out the grave,
strayed off, leaving the girl to herself.</p>
<p>The gloomy, strange-looking trees daunted Phyl,
and the grave, too young yet to have a headstone,
drew her towards it, yet repelled her.</p>
<p>It was like meeting in a dream some one she
had loved and who had turned into a stranger in a
strange place.</p>
<p>Just as Charleston had dimmed Ireland in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
mind as a bright light dims a lesser light, so had
some influence come between her and the memory
of her father. That memory was just as distinct
as ever, but grief had died from it, as though Time
had been at work on it for years and years.</p>
<p>The Phyl who had stepped out of the south-bound
express and the girl of this morning were the
same in mind and body, but in soul and outlook they
had changed and were changing as though the air
of the south had some magic in it, some food that
had always been denied her and which was necessary
for her full being.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney returned from her wanderings
amongst the graves and they turned to the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It used to seem strange to me coming here when
I was a girl,&#8221; said she. &#8220;It always seemed as if I
was come to visit people who could never come to
see me. I used to pity them, but one gets older and
one gets wiser, and I fancy it&#8217;s they that pity us, if
they can see us at all, which isn&#8217;t often likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you think they come back?&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear child, if I told you what I thought,
you&#8217;d say I was plum crazy. But I&#8217;ll say this.
What do you think the Almighty made folk for? to
live a few years and then lie in a grave with folk
heaping flowers on them? There&#8217;s no such laziness
in nature. I don&#8217;t say there aren&#8217;t folk who
live their lives like as if they were dead, covered
with flowers and never moving a hand to help themselves
like some of those N&#8217;York women&mdash;but they
don&#8217;t count. They&#8217;re against nature and I guess
when they die they die, for they haven&#8217;t ever lived.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
Then, vehemently: &#8220;Of course, they come back,
not as ghosts peekin&#8217; about and making nuisances
of themselves, but they come back as people&mdash;which
is the sensible way and there&#8217;s nothing unsensible in
nature. Mind you, I don&#8217;t say there aren&#8217;t ghosts,
there are, for I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em; I saw Simon Pinckney,
the one that died of drink, as plain as my hand same
day he died, but he was a no account. He hadn&#8217;t
the making of a man, so he couldn&#8217;t come back as a
man, and he wasn&#8217;t a woman, so he couldn&#8217;t come
back as a woman; so he came back as a ghost. He
was always an uneasy creature, else I don&#8217;t suppose
he&#8217;d have come back as anything. When a man
wears out a suit of clothes he doesn&#8217;t die, he gets a
new one, and when he wears out a body&mdash;which
isn&#8217;t a bit more than a suit of clothes&mdash;he gets a new
one. If he hasn&#8217;t piled up grit enough in life to
pay for a new body, he goes about without one and
he&#8217;s a ghost. That&#8217;s my way of thinking and I
know&mdash;I know&mdash;n&#8217;matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put up her sunshade and they returned, driving
through the warm spring weather. Phyl was
silent, the day had taken possession of her. The
scent of pink mimosa filled the air, the blue sky
shewed here and there a few feather traces of white
cloud and the wind from the sea seemed the very
breath of the southern spring.</p>
<p>It seemed to Phyl as they drove that never before
had she met or felt the loveliness of life, never till
this moment when turning a corner the song of a
bird from a garden met them with the perfume of
jessamine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>Charleston is full of surprises like that, things
that snatch you away from the present or catch you
for a moment into the embrace of some old garden
lurking behind a wrought iron gate, or tell you a
love story no matter how much you don&#8217;t want to
hear it&mdash;or tease you, if you are a practical business
man, with some other futility which has nothing at
all to do with &#8220;real&#8221; life.</p>
<p>It seemed to Phyl as though, somehow, the whole
of the morning had been working up to that moment,
as though the perfume of the jessamine and
the song of the birds were the culmination of the
meaning of all sorts of things seen and unseen,
heard and unheard.</p>
<p>The message of the crazy old negress came back
to her. Who was Miss Julie? and who was the Mr.
Pinckney that was to meet her, and where was the
gate at which they were to meet in such a secretive
manner? Was it just craziness, or was it possible
that this was some real message delivered years and
years ago. A real lover&#8217;s message which the old
woman had once been charged to deliver and which
she had repeated automatically and like a parrot.</p>
<p>Miss Julie&mdash;could it be possible that she meant
Miss Juliet&mdash;The Juliet Mascarene to whom she,
Phyl, bore such a strong family likeness, could it be
possible that the likeness had started the old
woman&#8217;s mind working and had recalled the message
of a half-a-century ago to her lips.</p>
<p>It was a fascinating thought. Juliet had been in
love with one of the Pinckneys and this message was
from a Pinckney and one day, perhaps, most likely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
a fine spring day like to-day, Pinckney had given the
negro girl a message to give to Juliet, and the lovers
and the message and the bright spring day had
vanished utterly and forever leaving only Prue.</p>
<p>The gate would no doubt be the garden gate.
Phyl in all her life had never given a thought to
Love, she had known nothing of sentiment, that
much abused thing which is yet the salt of life, and
Romance for her had meant Adventure; all the
same she was now weaving all sorts of threads into
dreams and fancies. What appealed to her most
was her own likeness to Juliet, the girl who had
died so many, many years ago. A likeness incomplete
enough, according to Miss Pinckney, yet
strong enough to awaken memories in the mind of
Prue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Miss Pinckney,&#8221; said Phyl, as they sat
at luncheon that day, &#8220;you remember you
said yesterday that I was like Juliet Mascarene?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are,&#8221; replied the other, &#8220;though the likeness
is more noticeable at first sight as far as the
face goes&mdash;I&#8217;ve got a picture of her I will show
you, it&#8217;s upstairs in her room, the one next yours
on the same piazza&mdash;why do you ask me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking,&#8221; replied Phyl, &#8220;that the old
woman in the kitchen&mdash;Prue&mdash;may have meant
Juliet when she called me Julie, and that it was the
likeness that set her mind going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not impossible. Prue&#8217;s like that crazy old
clock Selina Pinckney left me in her will. It&#8217;d tell
you the day and the hour <i>and</i> the minute and the
year and the month and the weather. A little man
came out if it was going to rain and a little woman
if it was going to shine. But if you wanted to know
the time, it couldn&#8217;t tell you nearer than the hour
before last of the day before yesterday, and if you
sneezed near it, it&#8217;d up and strike a hundred and
twenty. I gave it to Rachel. She said it was
&#8216;some&#8217; clock, said it was a dandy for striking and
the time didn&#8217;t matter as the old kitchen clock saw
to that. It&#8217;s the same with Prue, the time doesn&#8217;t
matter, and they look up to her in the kitchen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
mostly, I expect, because she&#8217;s an oddity, same as
Selina Pinckney&#8217;s clock. Seems to me anything
crazy and useless is reckoned valuable these days,
and not only among coloured folk but whites&mdash;Dinah,
hasn&#8217;t Mr. Richard come in yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mistress Pinckney,&#8221; replied the coloured
girl, who had just entered the room, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen
no sign of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Running about without his luncheon,&#8221; grumbled
the lady, &#8220;said he had a deal in cotton on. I might
have guessed it.&#8221; Then when Dinah had left the
room and talking half to herself, &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing
Richard seems to think of but business or pleasure.
I&#8217;m not saying anything against the boy, he&#8217;s
as good and better than any of the rest, but like the
rest of them his character wants forming round
something real. It wasn&#8217;t so in the old days, they
were bad enough then and drank a lot more, but
they had in them something that made for something
better than business or pleasure. Matt Curry
didn&#8217;t go out and get killed for business or pleasure,
and all the old Pinckneys didn&#8217;t fight in the war or
fight with one another for business or pleasure.
There&#8217;s more in life than fooling with girls or buying
cotton or sailing yacht races, but Richard doesn&#8217;t
seem to see it. I did think that having a ward to
look after would have sobered him a bit and helped
to form his character&mdash;well, maybe it will yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be looked after,&#8221; said Phyl
flushing up, &#8220;and if Mr. Pinckney&mdash;&#8221; she stopped.
What she was going to say about Pinckney was not
clear in her mind, clouded as it was with anger&mdash;anger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
at the thought that she was an object to be
looked after by her &#8220;guardian,&#8221; anger at the implication
that he was not bothering to look after her,
being too much engaged in the business of fooling
with girls and buying cotton, and a reasonable anger
springing from and embracing the whole world that
held his beyond Vernons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said Miss Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing,&#8221; replied the other, trying to laugh
and making a failure of the business. &#8220;I was only
going to say that Mr. Pinckney must have lots to do
instead of wasting his time looking after strangers,
and if he hadn&#8217;t I don&#8217;t want to be looked after. I
don&#8217;t want him to bother about me&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221; It
did not want much more to start her off in a wild
fit of weeping about nothing, her mind for some
reason or other unknown even to herself was
worked up and seething just as on that day at Kilgobbin
when the woes of Rafferty had caused her
to make such an exhibition of herself in the library.
Anything was possible with Phyl when under the
influence of unreasoning emotion like this, anything
from flinging a knife at a person to breaking into
tears.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney knew it. Without understanding
in the least the psychological mechanism of Phyl, she
knew as a woman and by some electrical influence
the state of her mind.</p>
<p>She rose from the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stranger,&#8221; said she, taking the other by the arm,
&#8220;you call yourself a stranger. Come along upstairs
with me. I want to show you something.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>Still holding her by the arm, caressingly, she led
her off across the hall and up the stairs; on the first
floor landing she opened a door; it was the door of
the bedroom next to Phyl&#8217;s, a room of the same
shape and size and with the same view over the garden.</p>
<p>Just as the drawing-room had been kept in its
entirety without alteration or touch save the touch
of a duster, so had this room, the bedroom of a
girl of long ago, a girl who would now have been a
woman old and decrepit&mdash;had she lived.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the picture you wanted to see,&#8221; said Miss
Pinckney leading Phyl up to a miniature hanging on
the wall near the bed. &#8220;That&#8217;s Juliet, and if you
don&#8217;t see the family likeness, well, then, you must be
blind.&mdash;And you calling yourself a stranger!&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl looked. It was rather a stiff and finicking
little portrait; she fancied it was like herself but
was not sure, the colour of the hair was almost the
same but the way it was dressed made a lot of
difference, and she said so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they did their hair different then,&#8221; replied
Miss Pinckney, &#8220;and that reminds me, it&#8217;s
near time you put that tail up.&#8221; She sat down in
a rocker by the window and with her hands on her
knees contemplated Phyl. &#8220;I&#8217;m your only female
relative, and Lord knows I&#8217;m far enough off, anyhow
I&#8217;m something with a skirt on it, and brains
in its head, and that&#8217;s what a girl most wants when
she comes to your age. You&#8217;ll be asked to parties
and things here and you&#8217;ll find that tail in the way;
it&#8217;s good enough for a schoolgirl, but you aren&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
that any longer. I&#8217;ll get Dinah to do your hair,
something simple and not too grown-up&mdash;you don&#8217;t
mind an old woman telling you this&mdash;do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Phyl. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care how
my hair is done, you can cut it off if you like, but I
don&#8217;t want to go to parties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe you don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney,
&#8220;but, all the same, we&#8217;ll get Dinah to look to your
hair. Dinah can do most anything in that way;
she&#8217;d get twice the wages as a lady&#8217;s maid elsewhere
and she knows it, but she won&#8217;t go. I&#8217;ve
told her over and again to be off and better herself,
but she won&#8217;t go, sticks to me like a mosquito.
Well, this was Juliet&#8217;s room just as that&#8217;s her picture;
she died in that bed and everything is just
exactly as she left it. It was kept so after her
death. You see, it wasn&#8217;t like an ordinary person
dying, it was the tragedy of the whole thing that
stirred folk so, dying of a broken heart for the man
she was in love with. It set all the crazy poets off
like that clock of Selina Pinckney&#8217;s I was telling you
of. The <i>News and Courier</i> had yards of obituary
notice and verses. It made people forget the war
for a couple of days. There&#8217;s all her books on that
shelf and the diary the poor thing used to keep.
Open one of the drawers in that chest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl did so. The drawer was packed with
clothes neatly folded. The air became filled with
the scent of lavender.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are her things, everything she ever had
when she died. It may seem foolish to keep everything
like that, foolish and sentimental, and if she&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
died of measles or fallen down the stairs and killed
herself maybe her old things would have been given
away, but dying as she did&mdash;well, somehow, it didn&#8217;t
seem right for coloured girls to be parading about
in her things. Mrs. Beamis sniffed here just as she
sniffed in the drawing-room, and she said, one night,
something about sentiment, as if she was referring
to chicken cholera. I knew what she meant. She
meant we were a pack of fools. Well, she ought to
know. I reckon she ought to be a judge of folly&mdash;the
life she leads in Chicago. Umph!&mdash;Now I&#8217;m
going to lie down for an hour, and if you take my
advice you&#8217;ll do the same. The middle of the day
was meant to rest in. You can get to your room by
the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>She kissed Phyl and went off.</p>
<p>Phyl, instead of going to her room, took her seat
in the rocker and looked around her. The place
held her, something returned to it that had been
driven away perhaps by Miss Pinckney&#8217;s cheerful
and practical presence, the faint odour of lavender
still clung to the air, and the silence was unbroken
except for a faint stirring of the window curtains
now and then to the breeze from outside. Everything
was, indeed, just as it had been left, the toilet
tidies and all the quaint contraptions of the &#8217;50&#8217;s
and &#8217;60&#8217;s in their places. On the wall opposite the
bed hung several water colours evidently the work
of that immature artist Mary Mascarene, a watch
pocket hung above the bed, a thing embroidered with
blue roses, enough to disturb the sleep of any æsthete,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
yet beautiful enough in those old days. There was
only one stain mark in the scrupulous cleanliness and
neatness of the place&mdash;a panel by the window, once
white painted but now dingy-grey and scored with
lines. Phyl got up and inspected it more closely.
Children&#8217;s heights had evidently been measured here.
There was a scale of feet marked in pencil, initials,
and dates. Here was &#8220;M. M.,&#8221; probably Mary
Mascarene, &#8220;2 ft. 6 inches. Nineteen months,&#8221; and
the date &#8220;April, 1845,&#8221; and again a year later, &#8220;M. M.
2 ft. 9-1/2 inches, May, 1846.&#8221; So she had
grown three and a half inches in a year. &#8220;J. M.&#8221;&mdash;Juliet
without doubt&mdash;&#8220;3 feet, 3 years old, 1845.&#8221;
Juliet was evidently the elder&mdash;so it went on right
into the early &#8217;60&#8217;s, mixed here and there with other
initials, amongst which Phyl made out &#8220;J. J.&#8221; and
&#8220;R. P.,&#8221; children maybe staying at the house and
measured against the Mascarene children&mdash;children
now old men and women, possibly not even that. It
was in the kindly spirit of Vernons not to pass a
painter&#8217;s brush over these scratchings, records of the
height of a child that lingered only in the memory
of the old house.</p>
<p>Phyl turned from them to the bookshelf and the
books it contained. &#8220;Noble Deeds of American
Women,&#8221; &#8220;Precept on Precept,&#8221; &#8220;The Dairyman&#8217;s
Daughter,&#8221; and the &#8220;New England Primer&#8221;&mdash;with
a mark against the verses left &#8220;by John Rogers to
his wife and nine small children, and one at the
breast, when he was burned at the stake at Smithfield
in 1555.&#8221; There were also books of poetry,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
Bryant, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, &#8220;Powhatan, a
metrical romance in seven cantos by Seba Smith,&#8221;
and several others.</p>
<p>Phyl did something characteristic. She gathered
every single book into a pile in her arms and sat
down on the floor with them to have a feast. This
devourer of books was omnivorous in her tastes,
especially if it were a question of sampling, and she
had enough critical faculty to enable her to enjoy
rubbish. She lingered over Powhatan and its dedication
to the &#8220;Young People of the United States&#8221;
and then passed on to the others till she came to a
little black book. It was Juliet Mascarene&#8217;s diary
and proclaimed the fact openly on the first page with
the statements: &#8220;I am twelve years old to-day and
Aunt Susan has given me this book to keep as my
diary and not to forget to write each day my evil
deeds as well as my good, which I will if I remember
them. She didn&#8217;t give me anything else. I had to-day
a Paris doll from Cousin Jane Pinckney who
has winking eyes which shut when you lay her on
her back and pantalettes with scallops which take
off and on and a trunk of clothes with a little key
to it. Father gave me a Bible and I have had other
things too numerous for mension.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>&#8220;Signed Juliet Mascarene.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>with never a date.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t done any evil deeds, or good ones that
I can remember, so I haven&#8217;t written in this book
for maybe a week. Mary and I, we went to a party
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
at the Pinckneys to-day at Bures, the Calhoun children
and the Rutledges were there and we had Lady
Baltimore cake and a good time. Mary wore her
blue organdie and looked very nice and Rupert
Pinckney was there, he&#8217;s fourteen and wouldn&#8217;t talk
to the children because they were too small for him,
I expect. He told me he was going to have a pony
same as Silas Rhett that threw him in the market
place Wednesday last and galloped all the way to
Battery before he was stopped, only his was to be a
better one with more shy in it, said Silas Rhett ought
to be tied on next time. Then old Mr. Pinckney
came in and shewed us a musical snuff-box and we
went home, and driving back Mary kicked me on the
shin by axident and I pinched her and she didn&#8217;t cry
till we&#8217;d got home, then she began to roar and
mother said it was my ungovernable temper, and I
said I wished I was dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t go to any more parties because it&#8217;s always
like that after them. Father told me I was
to pray for a new heart and not to have any supper
but Prue has brought me up a cake of her own making.
So that&#8217;s one evil deed to put down&mdash;It&#8217;s
just like Mary, any one else would have cried right
out in the carriage and not bottled it up and kept it
up till she got home.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a Friday and Prue says Friday parties
are always sure to end in trouble for the devil puts
powder in the cakes and the only way to stop him is
to turn them three times round when they&#8217;re baking
and touch them each time with a forked hazel twig.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl read this passage over twice. The mention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
of Prue interested her vastly. Prue even then had
evidently been a favourite of Juliet&#8217;s.</p>
<p>She read on hoping to find the name of the coloured
woman again, but it did not occur.</p>
<p>The diary, indeed, did not run over more than a
year and a half, but scrappy as it was and short in
point of time, the character of Juliet shone forth
from it, uneasy, impetuous, tormenting and loving.</p>
<p>Many books could not have depicted the people
round Vernons so well as this scribbling of a child.
Mary Mascarene, quiet, rather a spoil-sport and
something of a tale-teller, dead and gone Pinckneys
and Rhetts. Aunt Susan, Cousin Jane Pinckney,
Uncle George who beat his coloured man, Darius,
because the said Darius had let him go out with one
brass button missing from his blue coat. Simon
Pinckney&mdash;the one whose ghost walked&mdash;and who
&#8220;fell down in the garden because he had the hiccups,&#8221;
these and others of their time lived in the little black
book given by the miserly Aunt Susan &#8220;to keep as
my diary and not to forget to write each day my evil
deeds as well as my good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Towards the end there was another reference to
Rupert Pinckney, the tragic lover of the future:</p>
<p>&#8220;Rupert Pinckney was here to-day with his mother
to luncheon and we had a palmetto salad and mother
said when he was gone he was the most frivulus boy
in Charleston, whatever that was, and too much of
a dandy, but father said he had stuff in him and
Aunt Susan, who was here too, said &#8216;Yes, stuff and
nonsense,&#8217; and I said he could ride his pony without
tumbling off like Silas Rhett, anyhow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then they went on talking about his people and
how they hadn&#8217;t as much money as they used to have,
and Aunt Susan said that was so, and the worst of
it is they&#8217;re spending more money than they used to
spend, and father said, well, anyhow, that wasn&#8217;t a
very common complaint with <i>some</i> people and he
left the room. He never stays long in the room
with Aunt S.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the Pinckneys are real nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Simon Mascarene from Richmond and his
wife came to see us to-day and stay for a week.
They drove here in their own carriage with four
brown horses and you could not tell which horse was
which, they are so alike, they are very fine people
and Mr. M. has a red face&mdash;not the same red as
Mr. Simon Pinckney&#8217;s, but different somehow&mdash;more
like an apple, and a high nose which makes him look
very grand and fine.&#8221; The same Simon Mascarene,
no doubt, that came to the wedding of Charles Pinckney
in 1880 as old Simon Mascarene, the one whose
flowered carpet bag still lingered in the memory of
Miss Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. M. is very fine too and beautifully dressed
and mother gave her a great bouquet of geraniums
and garden flowers with a live green caterpillar looping
about in the green stuff which nobody saw but
me, till it fell on Mrs. M.&#8217;s knee and she screamed.
There is to be a big party to-morrow and the Pinckneys
are coming and Rupert.&#8221;</p>
<p>There the diary ended.</p>
<p>Phyl put it back on the shelf with the books.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>She had not the knowledge necessary to visualise
the people referred to, those people of another day
when Planters kept open house, when slaves were
slaves and Bures the home of the old gentleman with
the musical snuff-box, but she could visualise Juliet
as a child. The writing in the little book had
brought the vision up warm from the past and it
seemed almost as though she might suddenly run in
from the sunlit piazza that lay beyond the waving
window curtains.</p>
<p>There was a bureau in one corner, or rather one
of those structures that went by the name of Davenports
in the days of our fathers. Phyl went to it
and raised the lid. She did so without a second
thought or any feeling that it was wrong to poke
about in a place like this and pry into secrets. Juliet
seemed to belong to her as though she had been a
sister, her own likeness to the dead girl was a bond
of attraction stronger than a family tie, and Juliet&#8217;s
mournful love story completed the charm.</p>
<p>The desk contained very little, a seal with a dove
on it, some sticks of spangled sealing-wax, a paper
knife of coloured wood with a picture of Benjamin
Franklin on the handle and some sheets of note-paper
with gilt edges.</p>
<p>Phyl noticed that the gilt was still bright.</p>
<p>She took out the paper knife and looked at it, and
then held the blade to her lips to feel the smoothness
of it, drawing it along so that her lips touched every
part of the blade.</p>
<p>Then she put it back, and as she did so a little
panel at the back of the desk fell forward disclosing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
a cache containing a bundle of letters tied round with
ribbon.</p>
<p>Phyl started as though a hand had been laid on
her arm. The point of the paper knife must have
touched the spring of the panel, but it seemed as
though the desk had suddenly opened its hand, closed
and clasping those letters for so many years. For
a moment she hesitated to touch them. Then she
thought of all the time they had lain there and a
feeling that Juliet wouldn&#8217;t mind and that the old
bureau had told its secret without being asked, overcame
her scruples. She took the letters and sitting
down again on the floor, untied the ribbon.</p>
<p>There were no envelopes. Each sheet of paper
had been carefully folded and sealed with green wax,
with the seal leaving the impression of the dove.
There was no address, and they had evidently been
tied together in chronological order. But the handwriting
was the handwriting of Juliet Mascarene
fully formed now.</p>
<p>The first of these things ran:</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t my fault. I didn&#8217;t create old Mr. Gadney
and send him to church to keep us talking in the
street like that. I did <i>not</i> see you. You couldn&#8217;t
have passed, and if you did you must have been invisible.
I feel dreadfully wicked writing to you.
Do you know this is a clandestine correspondence
and must stop at once? You mustn&#8217;t <i>ever</i> write to
me again, nor I mustn&#8217;t see you. Of course I can&#8217;t
help seeing you in church and on the street&mdash;and I
can&#8217;t help thinking about you. They&#8217;ll be making
me try and stop breathing next. I don&#8217;t care a button
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
for the whole lot of them. It was all Aunt
Susan&#8217;s doing, only for her my people would never
have quarrelled with yours and I wouldn&#8217;t have been
so miserable. I feel sometimes as if I could just
take a boat and sail off to somewhere where I would
never see any people again.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was clever of you to send your letter by P.
This goes to you by the same hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no signature and no date.</p>
<p>Phyl turned the sheet of paper over to make sure
again that there was no address. As she did so a
faint, quaint perfume came to her as though the old-fashioned
soul of the letter were released for a moment.
It was vervain, the perfume of long ago, beloved
of the Duchesse de Chartres and the ladies
of the forties.</p>
<p>She laid the letter down and took up the next.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is <i>wicked</i> of you. My people never would be
so mean as to quarrel with your people or look down
on them because they have lost money. Why did
you say that&mdash;and you know I said in my last letter
that I could not write to you again. I was shocked
when P. pinched my arm as I was passing her on
the stairs and handed me your note&mdash;Don&#8217;t you&mdash;don&#8217;t
you&mdash;how shall I say it? Don&#8217;t you think
you and I could meet and speak to one another somewhere
instead of always writing like this? Somewhere
where no one could see us. Do you know&mdash;do
you know&mdash;do you, ahem! O dear me&mdash;know
that just inside our gate there&#8217;s a little arbour. The
tiniest place. When I was a child I used to play
there with Mary at keeping house, there&#8217;s a seat just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
big enough for two and we used to sit there with our
dolls. No one can see the gate from the lower
piazza, and the gate doesn&#8217;t make any noise opening,
for father had it oiled&mdash;it used to squeak a bit from
rust, but it doesn&#8217;t now and I&#8217;ll be there to-morrow
night at nine&mdash;in the arbour&mdash;at least I <i>may</i> be there.
I just want to tell you in a way I can&#8217;t in a letter
that my people aren&#8217;t the sort of folk to sneer at
any one because they have lost money.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sending this by P.</p>
<p>&#8220;The arbour is just back of the big magnolia as
you come in, on the left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl gave a little laugh. Then with half-closed
eyes she kissed the letter, laid it softly on the floor
beside the first and went on to the next.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to-night. I have to go to the Calhouns.
It is just as well, for I have a dread of people suspecting
if we meet too often. No one sees us meet.
No one knows, and yet I fear them finding out just
by instinct. Father said to me the other day, &#8216;What
makes you seem so happy these times?&#8217; If Mary
had been alive she would have found out long ago,
for I never could keep anything hid from her. I was
nearly saying to him, &#8216;If you want to know why I
am so happy go and ask the magnolia tree by the
gate.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I feel as if I were deceiving him and
everybody. I am, and I don&#8217;t care&mdash;I don&#8217;t care if
they knew. O my darling! My darling! My
darling! If the whole world were against you I
would love you all the more. I will love you all
my life and I will love you when I am dead.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>Phyl&#8217;s eyes grew half blind with tears.</p>
<p>This cry from the Past went to her heart like a
knife. The wind, strengthening for a moment,
moved the window curtains, bringing with it the
drowsy afternoon sounds of Charleston, sounds that
seemed to mock at this voice declaring the deathlessness
of its love. It was impossible to go on reading.
Impossible to expose any more this heart that had
ceased to beat.</p>
<p>The meetings in the arbour behind the magnolia
tree, the kisses, the words that the leaves and birds
alone could hear&mdash;they had all ended in death.</p>
<p>It did not matter now if the garden gate creaked
on its hinges, or if watching eyes from the piazza
saw the glossy leaves stirring when no wind could
shake them&mdash;nothing mattered at all to these people
now.</p>
<p>She put all the letters back in the bureau, carefully
closing them in the secret drawer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Miss Pinckney,&#8221; said Phyl that night as
they sat at supper, &#8220;when you left me this
afternoon in Juliet&#8217;s room I stopped to look at the
books and things and when I opened the bureau I
touched a spring by accident and a little panel fell
out and I found a lot of old letters behind it. It
was wrong of me to go meddling about and I thought
I ought to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old letters,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney, &#8220;you don&#8217;t
say&mdash;what were they about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I read one or two,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;I&#8217;d never,
never have dreamed of touching them only&mdash;only
they were hers&mdash;they were to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rupert?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Love letters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He kept all her letters,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and they came
back to her after he was killed. He was killed here
in Charleston, at Fort Sumter, in the war; they
brought him across here and carried him on a
stretcher and she&mdash;well, well, it&#8217;s all done with and
let it rest, but it is strange that those letters should
have fallen into your hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, strange?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; burst out Miss Pinckney. &#8220;Why I have
dusted that old bureau inside and out a hundred
times, and pulled out the drawers and pushed them
in and it never shewed sign of having anything in it
but emptiness, and you don&#8217;t do more&#8217;n look at it
and you find those letters. It&#8217;s just as if the thing
had deceived me. I don&#8217;t mind, and I don&#8217;t want
to see them, they weren&#8217;t intended for other eyes
than his and hers&mdash;and maybe yours since they were
shewn you like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it wrong of me to look at them?&#8221; asked
Phyl. &#8220;I never would have done it only&mdash;only&mdash;Oh,
I don&#8217;t know, I somehow felt she wouldn&#8217;t mind.
She seemed like a sister&mdash;I would never dream of
looking at another person&#8217;s letters but she did not
seem like another person. I can&#8217;t explain. It was
just as though the letters were my own&mdash;just exactly
as though they were my own when I found them in
my hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl was talking with her eyes fixed before her
as though she were looking across some great distance.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney gave a little shiver, then supper
being over she rose from the table and led the way
from the room.</p>
<p>Richard Pinckney had dined with them but he
was out for supper somewhere or another. They
went to the drawing-room and had not been there
for more than a few minutes when Frances Rhett
was announced.</p>
<p>The Rhetts were on intimate enough terms with
the Pinckneys to call in like this without ceremony;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
Frances had called to speak to Miss Pinckney about
some charity affair she was getting up in a hurry,
but she had not been five minutes in the room before
Phyl knew that she had called to look at her. To
look at the girl who had come to live with the Pinckneys,
the red headed girl. Phyl did not know that
girls of Frances&#8217; type dread red haired girls, if they
are pretty, as rabbits dread stoats, but she did know
in some uncanny way that Frances Rhett considered
Richard Pinckney as her own property to be protected
against all comers.</p>
<p>All at once and new born, the woman awoke in
her instinctive, mistrustful and armed.</p>
<p>Frances Rhett, despite Miss Pinckney&#8217;s dispraise
of her, was a most formidable person as far as the
opposite sex was concerned. One of the women of
whom other women say, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know what
he sees in her, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>A brunette of eighteen who looked twenty, full-blooded,
full lipped, full curved, sleepy-eyed, she
seemed dressed by nature for the part of the world
and the flesh&mdash;with a hint of the devil in those deep,
dark, pansy blue eyes that seemed now by artificial
light almost black.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll subscribe ten dollars,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney;
&#8220;I reckon the darkie babies won&#8217;t be any the
worse for a <i>crêche</i> and maybe not very much better
for it. If you could get up an institution to distil
good manners and respect for their betters into their
heads I&#8217;d give you forty. I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know
what the coloured folk of Charleston are coming
to, one of them nearly pushed me off the sidewalk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
the other day, bag of impudence! and the way they
look at one in the street with that sleery leery what-d&#8217;-you-call-yourself-you-white-trash
grin on their
faces s&#8217;nough to raise Cain in any one&#8217;s heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; replied the dark girl, &#8220;and they are getting
worse; the whip is the only thing that as far as
I can see ever made them possible, and what we have
now is the result of your beautiful Abolitionists.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call them my beautiful Abolitionists,&#8221; replied
the other. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t make &#8217;em. All the same
I don&#8217;t believe in whipping and never did. It&#8217;s the
whip that whipped us in the war. If white folk had
treated black folk like Christians slavery would have
been the greatest god-send to blacks. It was what
stays are to women. But they didn&#8217;t. The low
down white made slavery impossible with his whipping
and oppression and <i>we</i> had to suffer. Well, we
haven&#8217;t ended our sufferings and if these folk go on
multiplying like rabbits there&#8217;s no knowing what
we&#8217;ve got to suffer yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Rhett concurred and took her departure.
&#8220;Now, that girl,&#8221; said the elder lady when Frances
Rhett was gone, &#8220;is just the type of the people I was
telling her about. No idea but whipping. <i>She</i>
wouldn&#8217;t have much mercy on a human creature black
or tan <i>or</i> white. Thick skinned. She didn&#8217;t even
see that I was telling her so to her face. Wonder
what brought her here this hour with her <i>crêche</i>.
It&#8217;s just a fad. If they got up a charity to make alligator
bait of the black babies so&#8217;s to sell the alligator
skins to buy pants with texts on them for the
Hottentots it&#8217;d be all the same to her. Something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
to gad about with. I wish I&#8217;d kept that ten dollars
in my pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney went to bed early that night&mdash;before
ten&mdash;and Phyl, who was free to do as she chose,
sat for a while in the lower piazza watching the moon
rising above the trees. She had a little plan in her
mind, a plan that had only occurred to her just before
the departure of Miss Pinckney for bed.</p>
<p>She sat now watching the garden growing ghostly
bright, the sun dial becoming a moon dial, the carnations
touched by that stillness and mystery which
is held only in the light of the moon and the light of
the dawn.</p>
<p>Phyl found herself sitting between two worlds.
In the light of the northern moon in summer there
is a vague rose tinge to be caught at times and in
places when it falls full on house wall or the road on
which one is walking. The piazza to-night had this
living and warm touch. It seemed lit by a glorified
ethereal day. A day that had never grown up and
would never lose the charm of dawn.</p>
<p>Yet the garden to which she would now turn her
eyes shewed nothing of this. Night reigned there
from the cherokee roses moving in the wind to the
carnations motionless, moon stricken, deathly white.</p>
<p>Sure that Miss Pinckney would not come down
again, Phyl rose and crossed the garden towards the
gate.</p>
<p>She wanted to see if the trysting place behind the
magnolia and the bushes that grew about it were
still there.</p>
<p>At the gate she paused for a moment, glancing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
back at the house as Juliet Mascarene might have
done on those evenings when she had an appointment
with her lover. Then, pushing through the
bushes and past the magnolia trees she found herself
in a little half moonlit space, a natural arbour
through whose roof of leaves the moonlight came in
quavering shafts. She stood for a moment absolutely
still whilst her eyes accustomed themselves to
the light. Then she began to search for the seat she
guessed to be there, and found it. It was between
an oak bole and the wall of the garden, and the
bushes behind had grown so that their branches half
covered it. Neglected, forsaken, unknown, perhaps,
to the people now living in Vernons it had lingered
with the fidelity of inanimate things, protected by the
foliage of the southern garden from prying eyes.</p>
<p>She pushed back the leaves and branches and bent
them out of the way, then she took her seat, and as
she did so several of the bent branches released themselves
and closed half round her in a delightful embrace.</p>
<p>From here she could see brokenly the garden and
the walk leading from the gate, with the light of the
moon now strong upon the walk. The night sounds
of the street just beyond the wall came mixed with
the stir of foliage as the wind from the sea pressed
over the trees like the hand of a mesmerist inducing
sleep.</p>
<p>So it was here that Juliet Mascarene had sat with
Rupert Pinckney on those summer nights when the
world was younger, before the war. The war that
had changed everything whilst leaving the roses untouched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
and the moonlight the same on the bird-haunted
garden of Vernons.</p>
<p>Everything was the same here in this little space
of flowers and trees. But the lovers had vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;For man walketh in a vain shadow and disquieteth
himself in vain.&#8221; The words strayed
across Phyl&#8217;s mind brought up by recollection. &#8220;He
cometh up and is cut down like a flower, he fleeth as
it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trees seemed whispering it, the eternal statement
that leaves the eternal question unanswered.</p>
<p>The garden was talking to her, the night, the very
bushes that clasped her in a half embrace; perfumes,
moonlight, the voice of the wind, all were part of the
spell that bound her, held her, whispered to her. It
was as though the love letter of Juliet had led her
here to show her as in a glass darkly the vainness of
love in the vainness of life.</p>
<p>Vainly, for as she sat watching in imagination
the forms of the lost lovers parting there at the gate,
suddenly there came upon her a stirring of the soul,
a joyous uplifting as though wings had been given to
her mind for one wild second raising it to the heights
beyond earthly knowledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Love can never die.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was as though some ghostly voice had whispered
this fact in her ear.</p>
<p>Juliet was not dead nor the man she loved, changed
maybe but not dead. In some extraordinary way she
knew it as surely as though she herself had once been
Juliet.</p>
<p>Religion to Phyl had meant little, the Bible a book
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
of fair promises and appalling threats, vague promises
but quite definite threats. As a quite small child
she had gathered the impression that she was sure
to be damned unless she managed to convert herself
into a quite different being from the person she knew
herself to be. Death was the supreme bogey, the
future life a thing not to be thought of if one wanted
to be happy.</p>
<p>Yet now, just as if she had been through it all, the
truth came flooding on her like a golden sea, the
truth that life never loses touch with life, that the
body is only a momentary manifestation of the ever
living spirit.</p>
<p>Meeting Street, the old house so full of memories,
Juliet&#8217;s letters, the garden, they had all been stretching
out arms to her, trying to tell her something,
whispering, suggesting, and now all these vague
voices had become clear, as though strengthened by
the moonlight and the mystery of night.</p>
<p>Clear as lip-spoken words came the message:</p>
<p>&#8220;You have lived before and we say this to you, we,
the things that knew you and loved you in a past
life.&#8221;</p>
<p>A step that halted outside close to the garden gate
broke the spell, the gate turned on its hinges shewing
through its trellis work the form of a man. It
was Pinckney just returned from some supper-party
or club.</p>
<p>Phyl caught her breath back. Suddenly, and at
the sight of Pinckney, Prue&#8217;s words of that morning
entered her mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Julie, Massa Pinckney told me tell yo&#8217; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
be at de gate t&#8217;night same&#8217;s las&#8217; night. Done you let
on as I told you.&#8221;</p>
<p>And here he was, the man who had been occupying
her thoughts and who was beginning to occupy
her dreams, and here she was as though waiting for
him by appointment.</p>
<p>But there was much more than that. Worlds and
worlds more than that, a whole universe of happiness
undreamed of.</p>
<p>She rose from the seat and the parted bushes rustled
faintly as they closed behind her.</p>
<p>Pinckney, who had just shut the gate, heard the
whisper of the leaves, he turned and saw a figure
standing half in shadow and half in moonlight. For
a moment he was startled, fancying it a stranger,
then he saw that it was Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Why, Phyl, what are you
doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The commonplace question shattered everything
like a false note in music.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; she answered. Then without a word
more she ran past him and vanished into the house.</p>
<p>Pinckney cast the stump of his cigar away.</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth is the matter with her now?&#8221; said
he to himself. &#8220;What on earth have I done?&#8221;</p>
<p>The word she had uttered carried half a sob with
it, it might have been the last word of a quarrel.</p>
<p>He stood for a moment glancing around. The
wild idea had entered his mind that she had been
there to meet some one and that his intrusion had
put her out.</p>
<p>But there was no one in the garden; nothing but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
the trees and the flowers, wind shaken and lit by the
moon, the same placid moon that had lit the garden
of Vernons for the lovers of whom he knew nothing
except by hearsay, and for whom he cared nothing
at all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p>When Phyl awoke from sleep next morning,
the brightness of the South had lost some of
its charm.</p>
<p>Something magical that had been forming in her
mind and taking its life from Vernons had been shattered
last night by Pinckney&#8217;s commonplace question.</p>
<p>This morning, looking back on yesterday, she
could remember details but she could not recapture
the essence. The exaltation that had raised her
above and beyond herself. It was like the remembrance
of a rose contrasted with the reality.</p>
<p>The whole day had been working up to that
moment in the little arbour, when her mind, tricked
or led, had risen to heights beyond thought, to happiness
beyond experience, only to be cast down from
those heights by the voice of reality.</p>
<p>The thing was plain enough to common sense; she
had let herself be over-ruled by Imagination, working
upon splendid material. Prue&#8217;s message, her
own likeness to Juliet, Juliet&#8217;s letters, the little
arbour, those and the magic of Vernons had worked
upon her mind singly and together, exalting her into
a soul-state utterly beyond all previous experience.</p>
<p>It was as though she had played the part of Juliet
for a day, suffered vaguely and enjoyed in imagination
what Juliet had suffered and enjoyed in life,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
known Love as Juliet had known it&mdash;for a moment.</p>
<p>The brutal touch of the Real coming at the supreme
moment to shatter and shrivel everything.</p>
<p>And the strange thing was that she had no regrets.</p>
<p>Looking back on yesterday, the things that had
happened seemed of little interest. Sleep seemed
to have put an Atlantic ocean between her and them.</p>
<p>Coming down to breakfast she found Pinckney
just coming in from the garden; he said nothing about
the incident of the night before, nor did she, there
were other things to talk about. Seth, one of the
darkies, had been &#8216;kicking up shines,&#8217; he had given
impudence to Miss Pinckney that morning. Impudence
to Miss Pinckney! You can scarcely conceive
the meaning of that statement without a personal
knowledge of Miss Pinckney, and a full understanding
of the magic of her rule.</p>
<p>Seth was, even now, packing up the quaint contraptions
he called his luggage, and old Darius, the
coloured odd job man, was getting a barrow out of
the tool-house to wheel the said luggage to Seth&#8217;s
grandmother&#8217;s house, somewhere in the negro quarters
of the town. The whole affair of the impudence
and dismissal had not taken two minutes, but the
effects were widespread and lasting. Dinah was
weeping, the kitchen in confusion; one might have
thought a death had occurred in the house, and Miss
Pinckney presiding at the breakfast table was voluble
and silent by turns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Pinckney with all the light-heartedness
of a man towards domestic affairs.
&#8220;Seth&#8217;s not the only nigger in Charleston.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not bothering about his going,&#8221; replied Miss
Pinckney. &#8220;He was all thumbs and of no manner
of use but to make work; what upsets me is the way
he hid his nature. Time and again I&#8217;ve been good
to that boy. He looked all black grin and frizzled
head, nothing bad in him you&#8217;d say&mdash;and then! It&#8217;s
like opening a cupboard and finding a toad, and
there&#8217;s Dinah going on like a fool; she&#8217;s crying because
he&#8217;s going, not because he gave me impudence.
Rachel&#8217;s the same, and I&#8217;m just going now to the
kitchen to give them a talking to all round.&#8221;</p>
<p>Off she went.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what that means,&#8221; said Pinckney. &#8220;It&#8217;s
only once in a couple of years that there&#8217;s any trouble
with servants and then&mdash;oh, my! You see Aunt
Maria is not the same as other people because she
loves every one dearly, and looks on the servants as
part of the family. I expect she loves that black
imp Seth, for all his faults, and that&#8217;s what makes
her so upset.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same as I was about Rafferty,&#8221; said Phyl with a
little laugh.</p>
<p>Pinckney laughed also and their eyes met. Just
like a veil swept aside, something indefinable that
had lain between them, some awkwardness arising,
maybe, from the Rafferty incident, vanished in that
moment.</p>
<p>Phyl had been drawing steadily towards him
lately, till, unknown to her, he had entered into the
little romance of Juliet, so much so that if last night,
at that magical moment when he met her on entering
the gate&mdash;if at that moment he had taken her in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
arms and kissed her, Love might have been born
instantly from his embrace.</p>
<p>But the psychological moment had passed, a crisis
unknown to him and almost unknown to her.</p>
<p>And now, as if to seal the triumph of the commonplace,
suddenly, the vague reservation that had lain
between them, disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you taught me a lesson
that day, a lesson every man ought to be taught
before he leaves college.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; asked Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never to interfere in household affairs. Of
course Rafferty wasn&#8217;t exactly a household affair
because he belonged mostly to the stable, still he was
your affair more than mine. Household affairs
belong to women, and men ought to leave them
alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Phyl, &#8220;but all the same
I was wrong. Do you know I&#8217;ve never apologised
for what I said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say?&#8221; asked he with an artless air
of having forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I said&mdash;things, and&mdash;I apologise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I said&mdash;things, and I apologise&mdash;come on,
let&#8217;s go out. I have no business this morning and
I&#8217;d like to show you the town&mdash;if you&#8217;d care to
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about Miss Pinckney?&#8221; asked Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;The Seth
trouble will keep her busy till lunch time and I&#8217;ll leave
word we&#8217;ve gone out for a walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl ran upstairs and put on her hat. As they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
were passing through the garden the thought came to
her just for a moment to show him the little arbour;
then something stopped her, a feeling that this
humble little secret was not hers to give away, and a
feeling that Pinckney wouldn&#8217;t care. Dead lovers
vanished so long and their affairs would have little
interest for his practical mind.</p>
<p>The morning was warmer even than yesterday.
The joyous, elusive, intoxicating spirit of the Southern
spring was everywhere, the air seemed filled with
the dust of sunbeams, filled with fragrance and lazy
sounds. The very business of the street seemed
part of a great universal gaiety over which the sky
heat hazy beyond the Battery rose in a dome of deep,
sublime tranquil blue.</p>
<p>They stopped to inspect the old slave market.</p>
<p>Then the remains of the building that had once
been the old Planters Hotel held Phyl like a wizard
whilst Pinckney explained its history. Here in the
old days the travelling carriages had drawn up, piled
with the luggage of fine folk on a visit to Charleston
on business or pleasure. The Planters was known
all through the Georgias and Virginia, all through
the States in the days when General Washington and
John C. Calhoun were living figures.</p>
<p>The ghost of the place held Phyl&#8217;s imagination.
Just as Meeting Street seemed filled with friendly old
memories on her first entering it, so did the air
around the ruins of the &#8220;Planters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then having paused to admire the gouty pillars of
St. Michael&#8217;s they went into the church.</p>
<p>The silence of an empty church is a thing apart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
from all other silences in the world. Deeper, more
complete, more filled with voices.</p>
<p>As they were entering a negro caretaker engaged
in dusting and tidying let something fall, and as the
silence closed in on the faint echo that followed the
sound they stopped, just by the font to look around
them. Here the spirit of spring was not. The
shafts of sunlight through the windows lit the old
fashioned box pews, the double decked pulpit, and
the font crowned with the dove with the light of long
ago. Sunday mornings of the old time assuredly
had found sanctuary here and the old congregations
had not yet quite departed.</p>
<p>The occasional noise of the caretaker as he moved
from pew to pew scarcely disturbed the tranquillity,
the scene was set beyond the reach of the sounds and
daily affairs of this world, and the actors held in a
medium unshakable as that which holds the ghostly
life of bees in amber and birds in marqueterie.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was George Washington&#8217;s pew,&#8221; whispered
Pinckney, &#8220;at least the one he sat in once. That&#8217;s
the old Pinckney pew, belonged to Bures&mdash;other
people sit there now. This is our pew&mdash;Vernons.
The Mascarenes had it in the old days, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl looked at the pew where Juliet Mascarene
had sat often enough, no doubt, whilst the preacher
had preached on the vanity of life, on the delusions
of the world and the shortness of Time.</p>
<p>Many an eloquent divine had stood in the pulpit
of St. Michael&#8217;s, but none have ever preached a sermon
so poignant, so real, so searching as that which
the old church preaches to those who care to hear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>They turned to go.</p>
<p>Outside Phyl was silent and Pinckney seemed occupied
by thoughts of his own. They had got to
that pleasant stage of intimacy where conversation
can be dropped without awkwardness and picked up
again haphazard, but you cannot be silent long in
the streets of Charleston on a spring day. They
visited the market-place and inspected the buzzards
and then, somehow, without knowing it, they drifted
on to the water side. Here where the docks lie
deserted and the green water washes the weed grown
and rotting timbers of wharves they took their seats
on a baulk of timber to rest and contemplate things.</p>
<p>&#8220;There used to be ships here once,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Lots of ships&mdash;but that was before the war.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was silent and Phyl glanced sideways at him,
wondering what was in his mind. She soon found
out. A struggle was going on between his two
selves, his business self that demanded up-to-dateness,
bustle, and the energetic conduct of affairs, and
his other self that was content to let things lie, to see
Charleston just as she was, unspoiled by the thing we
call Business Prosperity. It was a battle between
the South and the North in him.</p>
<p>He talked it out to her. Went into details,
pointed to Galveston and New Orleans, those greedy
sea mouths that swallow the goods of the world
and give out cotton, whilst Charleston lay idle, her
wharves almost deserted, her storehouses empty.</p>
<p>He spoke almost vehemently, spoke as a business
man speaks of wasted chances and things neglected.
Then, when he had finished, the girl put in her word.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said she, &#8220;it may be so but I don&#8217;t want it
any different from what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinckney laughed, the laugh of a man who is confessing
a weakness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I do either,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>It was rank blasphemy against Business. At the
club you would often find him bemoaning the business
decay of the city he loved, but here, sitting by
the girl on the forsaken wharf, in the sunshine, the
feeling suddenly came to him that there was something
here that business would drive away. Something
better than Prosperity.</p>
<p>It was as though he were looking at things for a
moment through her eyes.</p>
<p>They came back through the sunlit streets to find
Miss Pinckney recovered from the Seth business, and
after luncheon that day, assisted by Dinah and the
directions of Miss Pinckney, Phyl&#8217;s hair &#8220;went up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beautiful,&#8221; said the old lady, as she contemplated
the result, &#8220;and more like Juliet than ever.
Take the glass and look at yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl did.</p>
<p>She did not see the beauty but she saw the change.
Her childhood had vanished as though some breath
had blown it away in the magic mirror.

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p>In a fortnight Phyl had adjusted herself to her
new environment so completely that to use Pinckney&#8217;s
expression, she might have been bred and born
in Charleston.</p>
<p>Custom and acquaintanceship had begun to dull
without destroying the charm of the place and the
ghostly something, the something that during the
first two days had seemed to haunt Vernons, the
something indefinable she had called &#8220;It&#8221; had withdrawn.</p>
<p>The spell, whatever it was, had been broken that
night in the garden, when Pinckney&#8217;s commonplace
remark had shattered the dream-state into which she
had worked herself with the assistance of Prue,
Juliet&#8217;s letters, the little secret arbour and the moonlight
of the South.</p>
<p>One morning, coming down to breakfast, she
found Miss Pinckney in agitation, an open telegram
in one hand and a feather duster in the other.</p>
<p>It was one of the early morning habits of Miss
Pinckney to range the house superintending things
with a feather duster in hand, not so much for use as
for the purpose of encouraging others. She was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
the breakfast room now dusting spasmodically
things that did not require dusting and talking all
the time, pausing every now and then to have another
glance at the telegram whilst Richard Pinckney, unable
to get a word in, sat on a chair, and Jim, the
little coloured page, who had brought in the urn,
stood by listening and admiring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty miles from here and ten from a railway
station,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney, &#8220;and how am I to get
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Automobile,&#8221; said Pinckney.</p>
<p>It was evidently not his first suggestion as to this
means of locomotion, for the suggestion was received
without an outburst, neither resented nor assented to
in fact. They took their seats at table and then it all
came out.</p>
<p>Colonel Seth Grangerson of Grangerson House,
Grangerville, S. Carolina, was ill. Miss Pinckney
was his nearest relative, the nearest at least with
whom he was not fighting, and he had wired to her,
or rather his son had wired to her, to come at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;As if I were a bird,&#8221; said the old lady. Grangerville
was a backwater place, badly served by the
railway, and it would take the best part of a day to
get there by ordinary means.</p>
<p>&#8220;A car will get you there inside a couple of hours,&#8221;
said Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;As if he couldn&#8217;t have sent for Susan Revenall,&#8221;
went on she as though oblivious to the suggestion,
&#8220;but I suppose he&#8217;s fought with them again. I
patched up a peace between them last midsummer,
but I suppose the patches didn&#8217;t stick; he&#8217;s fought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
with the Revenalls, he&#8217;s fought with the Calhouns,
he&#8217;s fought with the Beauregards, he&#8217;s fought with
the Tredegars&mdash;that man would fight with his own
front teeth if he couldn&#8217;t get anything better to fight
with, and now he&#8217;s dying I expect he reckons to have
a fight with me, just to finish off with. He killed his
poor wife, and Dick Grangerson would never have
gone off and got drowned only for him&mdash;Oh, he&#8217;s not
so bad,&#8221; turning to Phyl, &#8220;he&#8217;s good enough only for
that&mdash;will fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much pep,&#8221; said Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know what it is. They&#8217;re the
queerest lot the Almighty ever put feet on, and I
don&#8217;t mind saying it, even though they are relatives.&#8221;
Turning to Phyl. &#8220;I suppose you know, least I suppose
you think, that the Civil War was fought for
the emancipation of the darkies and that they <i>were</i>
emancipated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they weren&#8217;t&mdash;at least not at Grangersons.
While the Colonel&#8217;s father was fighting in the Civil
War, his first wife, she was a Dawson, kept things
going at home, and after the war was over and he
was back he took up the rule again. Emancipation&mdash;no
one would have dared to say the word to him,
he&#8217;d have killed you with a look. The North never
beat Grangerson, it beat Davis and one man and
another but it never beat Grangerson, he carried on
after the war just as he carried on before, told the
darkies that emancipation was nigger talk and they
believed him. People came round telling them they
were free, and all they got was broken heads. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
were a very tetchy lot, those niggers, are still what
are left of them. You see, they&#8217;ve always been
proud of being Grangerson&#8217;s niggers, that&#8217;s the sort
of man he is, able to make them feel like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Silas helps to carry on the place, doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221;
asked Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and just in the same tradition, only he&#8217;s
finding it doesn&#8217;t work, I suspect. You see, the old
darkies are all right, but when he&#8217;s forced to get new
labour he has to get the new darkies and they&#8217;re all
wrong, and he thrashes them and they run away.
They never take the law of him either. I reckon
when they get clear of Silas they don&#8217;t stop running
till they get to Galveston.&#8221;</p>
<p>They talked of other things and then, breakfast
over, Miss Pinckney turned to Richard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what about that automobile?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have one at the door for you at ten,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>She turned to Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go with me&mdash;if you&#8217;d like to; you&#8217;d
be lonely here all by yourself, and you may as well
see Grangersons whilst the old man&#8217;s there, though
maybe he&#8217;ll be gone before we arrive. We may be
there for a couple of days, so you&#8217;d better take
enough things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she went off to dress herself for the journey,
and an hour later she appeared veiled and apparelled,
Dick following her with the luggage, a bandbox and a
bag of other days.</p>
<p>She got into the big touring car without a word.
Phyl followed her and Pinckney tucked the rug
round their knees.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the most careful driver in Charleston,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;and he knows the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney nodded.</p>
<p>She was flying straight in the face of her pet
prejudice. She was not in the least afraid of a
break down or an overset. An accident that did not
rob her of life or limb would indeed have been an
opportunity for saying &#8220;I told you so.&#8221; She was
chiefly afraid of running over things.</p>
<p>As Pinckney was closing the door on them who
should appear but Seth&mdash;Seth in a striped sleeved
jacket, all grin and frizzled head and bearing a bunch
of flowers in his hand. He had not been dismissed
after all. When Miss Pinckney had gone into the
kitchen to pay him his wages he had carried on so
that she forgave him. The flowers&mdash;her own
flowers just picked from the garden&mdash;were an offering,
not to propitiate but to please.</p>
<p>Pinckney laughed, but Miss Pinckney as she took
the bouquet scarcely noticed either him or Seth, her
mind was busy with something else.</p>
<p>She leaned over towards the chauffeur.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind you don&#8217;t run over any chickens,&#8221; said
she.</p>
<p>It was a gorgeous morning, with the sea mists
blowing away on the sea wind, swamp-land and river
and bayou showing streets and ponds of sapphire
through the vanishing haze.</p>
<p>Phyl was in high spirits; the tune of Camptown
Races, which a street boy had been whistling as they
started, pursued her. Miss Pinckney, dumb through
the danger zone where chickens and dogs and nigger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
children might be run over, found her voice in the
open country.</p>
<p>The bunch of flowers presented to her by Seth and
which she was holding on her lap started her off.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it is not a warning,&#8221; said she; &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t
be a bit surprised to find Seth Grangerson in his coffin
waiting for the flowers to be put on him; what put
it in to the darkey&#8217;s head to give me them! I don&#8217;t
know, I&#8217;m sure, same thing I suppose that put it into
his head to give me impudence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve taken him back,&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose I have,&#8221; said the other in a resigned
voice, &#8220;and likely to pay for my foolishness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinckney had said that it was only a two hours&#8217;
run from Charleston to Grangerville, but he had
reckoned without taking into consideration the badness
of some of the roads, and the intricacies of the
way, for it was after one o&#8217;clock when they reached
the little town beyond which, a mile to the West, lay
the Colonel&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>Grangerville lies on the border of Clarendon
county, a tiny place that yet supports a newspaper of
its own, the <i>Grangerville Courier</i>. The <i>Courier</i>
office, the barber&#8217;s shop and the hotel are the chief
places in Grangerville, and yellow dogs and black
children seem the bulk of the population, at least of
a warm afternoon, when drowsiness holds the place
in her keeping, and the light lies broad and steadfast
and golden upon the cotton fields, and the fields of
Indian corn, and the foliage of the woods that spread
to southward, enchanted woods, fading away into an
enchanted world of haze and sun and silence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>When the great Southern moon rises above the
cotton fields, Romance touches even Grangerville itself,
the baying of the yellow dog, darkey voices, the
distant plunking of a banjo, the owl in the trees&mdash;all
are the same as of old&mdash;and the houses are the
same, nearly, and the people, and it is hard to believe
that over there to the North the locomotives of the
Atlantic Coast railway are whistling down the night,
that men are able to talk to one another at a distance
of a thousand miles, fly like birds, live like fish, and
perpetuate their shadows in the &#8220;movies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grangersons lay a mile beyond the little town, a
solidly built mansion set far back from the road, and
approached by an avenue of cypress. As they drew
up before the pillared piazza, upon which the front
door opened, from the doorway, wide open this warm
day, appeared an old gentleman.</p>
<p>A very fine looking old man he was. His face,
with its predominant nose, long white moustache and
firm cleft chin, was of that resolute and obstinate
type which seems a legacy of the Roman Empire,
whose legionaries left much more behind them in
Gaul and Britain than Trajan arches and Roman
roads. He was dressed in light grey tweeds, his
linen was immaculate&mdash;youthful and still a beau in
point of dress, and bearing himself erect with the aid
of a walking stick, a crutch handled stick of clouded
malacca, Colonel Seth Grangerson, for he it was, had
come to his front door, drawn by the sound of the one
thing he detested more than anything in life, a motor
car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Lord! He&#8217;s not even in bed,&#8221; cried the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
outraged Miss Pinckney, who recognised him at once.
&#8220;All this journey and he up and about&mdash;it beats Seth
and his impudence!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel, whose age dimmed eyes saw nothing
but the automobile, came down the steps, panama hat
in hand, courtly, freezing, yet ready to explode on
the least provocation. Within touch of the car he
recognised the chief occupant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, God bless my soul,&#8221; cried he, &#8220;it&#8217;s Maria
Pinckney.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s me,&#8221; said the lady, &#8220;and I expected to
find you in bed or worse, and here you are up. Silas
sent me a telegram.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a fool,&#8221; cut in the old gentleman. &#8220;I had
one of my old attacks last night, and I told him I&#8217;d be
up and about in the morning&mdash;and I am. Good
Gad! Maria, you&#8217;re the last person in the world I&#8217;d
ever have expected to see in one of these outrageous
things.&#8221; He had opened the door of the car and
was presenting his arm to the lady.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can shut the door,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not getting out. The thing&#8217;s not more outrageous
than your getting up like that right after an
attack and dragging me a hundred miles from
Charleston over hill and dale&mdash;I&#8217;m not getting out,
I&#8217;m going right back&mdash;right back to Charleston.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel turned his head and called to a
darkey that had appeared at the front door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the luggage in,&#8221; said he. Miss Pinckney
got out of the car despite herself, half laughing, half
angry, and taking the gallantly proffered arm found
herself being led up the steps of Grangersons, pausing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
half way up to introduce Phyl, whom she had
completely forgotten till now.</p>
<p>The Colonel, like his son Silas, as will presently
be seen, had a direct way with women; the Grangersons
had pretty nearly always fallen in love at sight
and run away with their wives. Colonel Seth&#8217;s
father had done this, meeting, marrying and fascinating
the beautiful Maria Tredegar, and carrying her
off under his arm like a hypnotised fowl, and from
under the noses of half a dozen more eligible suitors,
just as now, the Colonel was carrying Maria Pinckney
off into his house half against her will. Phyl following
them, gazed round at the fine old oak panelled
hall, from which they were led into the drawing
room, a room not unlike the drawing room at Vernons,
but larger and giving a view of the garden
where the oleanders and cherokee money and the
crescent leaves of the blue gum trees were moving in
the wind. Colonel Seth, despite the war, had plenty
of roses and Grangersons was kept up in the old
style. Just as in Nuremberg and Vittoria we see
mediæval cities preserved, so to speak, under glass, so
at Grangersons one found the old Plantation, house
and all, miraculously intact, living, almost, one might
say, breathing.</p>
<p>The price of cotton did not matter much to the
Colonel, nor the price of haulage. This son of the
Southerner who had refused to be beaten by the
North in the war, cared for nothing much beyond the
ring of sky that made his horizon. Twice a year he
made a visit to Charleston, driving in his own carriage,
occasionally he visited Richmond or Durham,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
where he had an interest in tobacco; New York he
had never seen. He loathed railways and automobiles,
mainly, perhaps, because they were inventions
of the North, that is to say the devil. He had
a devilish hatred of the North. Not of Northerners,
but just of the North.</p>
<p>The word North set his teeth on edge. It did not
matter to him that Charleston was picking up some
prosperity in the way of phosphates, or that Chattanooga
was smelting ore into money, or that industrial
prosperity was abroad in the land; he was old
enough to have a recollection of old days, and from
the North had come the chilly blast that had blown
away that age.</p>
<p>A servant brought in cake and wine to stay the
travellers till dinner time, refreshment that Miss
Pinckney positively refused at first.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will stay the night,&#8221; said the Colonel, as he
helped her, &#8220;and Sarah will show you to your rooms
when we have had a word together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney, sipping her wine, made no reply,
then placing the scarcely touched glass on the table
and with her bonnet strings thrown back, she turned
to the Colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see the likeness?&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;What likeness?&#8221; asked the old gentleman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, God bless my soul, the likeness to Juliet
Mascarene. Phyl, turn your face to the light.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel, searching in his waistcoat pocket,
found a pair of folding glasses and put them on.</p>
<p>&#8220;She gets it from her mother&#8217;s side,&#8221; said Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
Pinckney, &#8220;the Lord knows how it is these things
happen, but it&#8217;s Juliet, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel removed his glasses, wiped them with
his handkerchief, and returned them to his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said he. Then in the fine old fashion he
turned to the girl, raised her hand to his lips and
kissed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phyl,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney, &#8220;would not you like
to have a look at the garden whilst we have a chat?
Old people&#8217;s talk isn&#8217;t of much interest to young people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old people,&#8221; cried the warrior. &#8220;There are no
old people in this room.&#8221; He made for the door
and opened it for Phyl, then he accompanied her
into the hall, where at the still open door he pointed
the way to the garden.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p>Outside Phyl stood for a moment to breathe
the warm scented air and look around her.</p>
<p>To be treated like a child by any other person than
Maria Pinckney would have incensed her, all the
same to be told to do a thing because it was good for
her, or because it was a pleasant thing to do, in the
teller&#8217;s opinion, was an almost certain way of making
her do the exact opposite.</p>
<p>The garden did not attract her, the place did.</p>
<p>That cypress avenue with the sun upon it, that
broad sweep of drive in front of the house, the distant
peeps of country between trees and the languorous
lazy atmosphere of the perfect day fascinated
her mind. She came along the house front to
the right, and found herself at the gate of the stable
yard.</p>
<p>The stable yard of Grangersons was an immense
flagged quadrangle bounded on the right, counting
from the point of entrance, by the kitchen premises.</p>
<p>There was stable room for forty horses, coach-house
accommodation for a dozen or more carriages.</p>
<p>The car had been run into one of the coach-houses
and the yard stood empty, sunlit, silent, save for the
voices of the pigeons wheeling in the air, or strutting
on the roof of the great barn adjoining the stables.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>One of the stable doors was open and as Phyl
crossed the yard a young man appeared at the open
door, shaded his eyes and looked at her. Then he
came forward. It was Silas Grangerson, and Phyl
thought he was the handsomest and most graceful
person she had ever seen in her life.</p>
<p>Silas was a shade over six feet in height, dark,
straight, slim yet perfectly proportioned; his face was
extraordinary, the most vivid thing one would meet
in a year&#8217;s journey, and with a daring, and at times,
almost a mad look unforgettable when once glimpsed.
Like the Colonel and like his ancestors Silas had a
direct way with women.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hallo,&#8221; said he, with the sunny smile of old
acquaintanceship, &#8220;where have <i>you</i> sprung from?&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl was startled for a moment, then almost
instantly she came in touch with the vein and mood
and mind of the other and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came with Miss Pinckney,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not from Charleston?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where do you live in Charleston? I&#8217;ve
never seen you and I know every&mdash;besides you don&#8217;t
look as if you belonged to Charleston&mdash;I don&#8217;t
believe you&#8217;ve come from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then where do you think I&#8217;ve come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Silas laughing, &#8220;but it
doesn&#8217;t matter as long as you&#8217;re here, does it?
&#8217;Scuse my fooling, won&#8217;t you&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t with a
stranger, but you don&#8217;t seem a stranger somehow&mdash;though
I don&#8217;t know your name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Phylice Berknowles,&#8221; said Phyl, glancing up at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
him and half wondering how it was that, despite his
good looks, his manhood, and their total unacquaintanceship,
she felt as little constrained in his
presence as though he were a boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;And my name is Silas Grangerson. Say, is
Maria Pinckney in the house with father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talking over old times, I s&#8217;pose?&#8221; said Silas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can hear them. It&#8217;s always the same when
they get together&mdash;and I suppose you got sick of it
and came out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they put me out&mdash;asked me wouldn&#8217;t I like
to look at the garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Already she had banded herself with him in mild
opposition to the elders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great&mdash;Jerusalem. They&#8217;re just like a pair of
old horses wanting to be left quiet and rub their nose-bags
together. Look at the garden! I can hear
them&mdash;come on and look at the horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the way to a loose box and opened the
upper door.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Flying Fox, she&#8217;s mine, the fastest trotter
in the Carolinas&mdash;you know anything about
horses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you did, somehow. Mind! she doesn&#8217;t
take to strangers. Mind! she bites like an alligator.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not me,&#8221; said Phyl, fondling the lovely but
fleering-eyed head protruding above the lower door.</p>
<p>&#8220;So she doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Silas admiringly, &#8220;she&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
taken to you&mdash;well, I don&#8217;t blame her. Here&#8217;s John
Barleycorn,&#8221; opening another door, &#8220;own brother to
the Fox, he&#8217;s Pap&#8217;s; he&#8217;s a bolter, and kicks like a
duck gun. She&#8217;s got all her vice at one end of her
and he at the other, match pair.&#8221; He whistled
between his teeth as he put up the bars, then he
shewed other horses, Phyl watching his every movement,
and wondering what it was that gave pleasure
to her in watching. Silas moved, or seemed to
move, absolutely without effort, and his slim brown
hands touched everything delicately, as though they
were touching fragile porcelain, yet those same
hands could bend an iron bar, or rein in John Barleycorn
even when the bit was between the said J.
B.&#8217;s teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the horses,&#8221; said he, flinging open a coach-house
door, &#8220;and that&#8217;s the shandrydan the governor
still drives in when he goes to Charleston. Look at
it. It was made in the forties, and you should see
it with a darkey on the box and Pap inside, and all
his luggage behind, and he going off to Charleston,
and the nigger children running after it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl inspected the mustard-yellow vehicle. Then
he closed the door on it, put up the bar, and, the
business of showing things over, did a little double
shuffle as though Phyl were not present, or as though
she were a boy friend and not a strange young
woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, do you like poetry?&#8221; said he, breaking off
and seeming suddenly to remember her presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Phyl. &#8220;At least&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s some.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There was an old hen and she had a wooden leg,
She went to the barn and she laid a wooden egg,
She laid it right down by the barn&mdash;don&#8217;t you think.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said she, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s just about time for another little drink&mdash;&#8217;
some sense in poetry like that, isn&#8217;t there? But all
the drinks are in the house and I don&#8217;t want to go in.
I&#8217;m hiding from Pap. Last night when he was ratty
with rheumatism, he let out at me, saying the young
people weren&#8217;t any good, saying Maria Pinckney
was the only person he knew with sense in her head,
called me a name because I poured him out a dose
of liniment instead of medicine, by mistake&mdash;though
he didn&#8217;t swallow it&mdash;and wished Maria was here.
So I just sent Jake, the page boy, off with a wire to
her; didn&#8217;t tell any one, just sent it. Come on and
look at the garden&mdash;you&#8217;ve got to look at the garden,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the way past the barn to a farmyard,
where hens were clucking and scratching and scraping
in the sunshine; the deep double bass grunting of
pigs came from the sties, by the low wall across
which one could see the country stretching far away,
the cotton fields, the woods, all hazed by the warmth
of the afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s sit down and look at the garden,&#8221; said he,
pointing to a huge log by the near wall&mdash;&#8220;and aren&#8217;t
the convolvuluses beautiful?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beautiful,&#8221; said Phyl, falling into the vein of
the other. &#8220;And listen to the roses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They grunt like that because it&#8217;s near dinner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
time&mdash;they&#8217;re pretty much like humans.&#8221; He took
a cigarette case from his pocket and a cigarette from
the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind smoking, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I daren&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maria Pinckney won&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not her&mdash;I smoked one once and it made me
sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, try another&mdash;I won&#8217;t look if you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll&mdash;she&#8217;ll smell it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not she, you can eat some parsley, that takes the
smell away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind telling her&mdash;it&#8217;s only&mdash;well,
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took a cigarette and he lit it for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blow it through your nose,&#8221; he commanded,
&#8220;that&#8217;s the way. Now let&#8217;s pretend we&#8217;re two old
darkies sitting on a log, you push against me and I&#8217;ll
push against you, you&#8217;re Jim and I&#8217;m Uncle Joseph.
&#8216;What yo&#8217; crowding me for, Jim,&#8217;&#8221; he squeezed
up gently against her, and Phyl jumped to her
feet.</p>
<p>He glanced up at her, sideways, laughing, and for
the life of her she could not be angry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;d better go and look at the
garden?&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a minute, sit down again. I won&#8217;t knock
against you. It was only my fun. We&#8217;ll pretend
I&#8217;m Pap, and you&#8217;re Maria Pinckney, if you like.
You&#8217;ve let your cigarette go out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can light it from mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl hesitated and was lost.</p>
<p>It was the nearest thing to a kiss, and as she drew
back with the lighted cigarette between her lips, she
felt a not unpleasant sense of wickedness, such as the
virtuous boy feels when led to adventure by the bad
boy. Sitting on a log, smoking cigarettes, talking
familiarly with a stranger, taking a light from him
in such a fashion with her face so close to his that his
eyes&mdash; They smoked in silence for a moment.</p>
<p>Then Silas spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you ever feel lonesome?&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Awfully&mdash;sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silence for a moment. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;I go off to Charleston when I feel like that&mdash;once
in a fortnight or so&mdash;Where do you live in
Charleston?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I live with Miss Pinckney&mdash;I thought you knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t say that. You only said you came
with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I live with her at Vernons. I&#8217;m Irish, y&#8217;
know. My&mdash;my father died in Charleston, and I
came from Ireland to live with Miss Pinckney. Mr.
Richard Pinckney is my guardian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your which? Dick Pinckney your guardian!
Why, he&#8217;s not older than I am&mdash;that fellow your
guardian&mdash;why, he wears a flannel petticoat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; cried Phyl, flinging away the
cigarette, which had become noxious, and roused to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
sudden anger by the slighting tone of the other.
&#8220;What do you mean by saying such a thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I only meant that he&#8217;s too awfully proper
for this life. He goes to Charleston races, but
never backs a horse, scarcely, and one Mint Julep
would make him see two crows. He&#8217;s a sort of distant
relation of ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl was silent. She resented his criticism of her
friend, and just in this moment the something mad
and harum scarum in the character of Silas seemed
shown up to her with electrical effect. Criticism is
a most dangerous thing to indulge in, unless anonymously
in the pages of a journal, for the right to
criticise has to be made good in the mind of the
audience, unless the audience is hostile to the criticised.</p>
<p>Then she said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about
Mint Juleps or race courses, but I do know that Mr.
Pinckney has been&mdash;is&mdash;is my friend, and I&#8217;d rather
not talk about him, if you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you&#8217;re huffed,&#8221; cried Silas exultingly, as
though he had scored a point at some game.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are&mdash;you&#8217;ve flushed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl turned pale, a deadly sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never dream of getting out of temper with
<i>you</i>,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>It was his turn to flush. You might have struck
Silas Grangerson without upsetting his balance, but
the slightest suspicion of a sneer raised all the devil
in him. Had Phyl been a man he would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
knocked him off the log. He cast the stump of his
cigarette on the ground and pounded it with his heel.
Had there been anything breakable within reach
he would have broken it. Her anger with him vanished
and she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve flushed now,&#8221; said she.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p>When they came round to the front of the
house they found Colonel Grangerson and
Miss Pinckney coming down the steps.</p>
<p>They were going to the garden in search of Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been looking at the horses,&#8221; said Silas,
after he had greeted Miss Pinckney. &#8220;No, sir, I did
not leave any of the doors open, but I&#8217;ve been looking
for Sam with a blacksnake whip to liven him up.
He left the grey without grooming after she was
brought in this morning, and I was rubbing her down
myself when this lady came into the yard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll skin that nigger,&#8221; cried the Colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll save you that trouble, sir,&#8221; replied
the son, as they turned garden-wards.</p>
<p>Silas had little use for &#8220;r&#8217;s&#8221; and said &#8220;suh&#8221; for
&#8220;sir&#8221; and &#8220;wah&#8221; for &#8220;war.&#8221; He was also quite a
different person in the presence of his father from
what he was when alone or in the presence of
strangers.</p>
<p>In the presence of his father, past generations
spoke in his every word and action, he became sedate,
deferential, leisurely. It was not fear of the elder
man that caused this change, it was reflection from
him.</p>
<p>The shadows were long in the garden, and away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
across the pastures, glimpsed beyond the cypress
hedge and bordering the cotton fields, the pond-shadows
cast by the live oaks at noon had become
river shadows, flowing eastward; the murmur of
bees filled the air like a haze of sound, and here and
there as they passed a bush coloured flowers detached
themselves and became butterflies.</p>
<p>They sat down on a great old stone bench lichened
and sun warmed to enjoy the view, and the Colonel
talked of tobacco and politics and cotton, including
them all in his conversation in the grand patriarchal
manner.</p>
<p>Phyl understanding little, and half drowsed by the
warmth and the buzzing of the bees and the voice of
the speaker, had given herself up to that lazy condition
of mind which is the next best thing to sleep,
when she was suddenly aroused. She was seated
between Miss Pinckney and Silas. Silas had pinched
her little finger.</p>
<p>She snatched her hand away, and turned towards
him. He was looking away over the pastures; his
profile showed nothing but its absolute correctness.
Miss Pinckney had noticed nothing, and the Colonel,
who had finished with cotton, looking at his watch,
declared that it was close on dinner time.</p>
<p>After supper that night, Phyl found herself in the
garden. Silas had not appeared at supper; the Colonel
had brought down a book of old photographs,
photographs of people and places dead or changed,
and he and Miss Pinckney became so absorbed in
them that they had little thought for the girl.</p>
<p>She went out to look at the moon, and it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
worth looking at, rising like a honey coloured shield
above the belt of the eastern woods.</p>
<p>The whole world was filled with the moonlight,
warm tinted, and ghostly as the light of vanished
days, white moths were flitting above the bushes,
and on the almost windless air the voice of an owl
came across the cotton fields.</p>
<p>Phyl reached the seat where they had all sat that
afternoon. It was still warm from the all-day sunshine,
and she sat down to rest and listen.</p>
<p>The owl had ceased crying, and through the
league wide silence faint sounds far and near told of
the life moving and thrilling beneath the night; the
boom of a beetle, voices from the distant road, and
now and then a whisper of wind rising and dying
out across the garden and the trees.</p>
<p>A faint sound came from behind the seat, and
before Phyl could turn two warm hands covered
her eyes.</p>
<p>She plucked them away and stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>wish</i> you wouldn&#8217;t do things like that,&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;How <i>dare</i> you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help it,&#8221; replied the other, &#8220;you looked
so comfortable. I didn&#8217;t mean to startle you. I
thought you must have heard me coming across the
grass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t&mdash;and you shouldn&#8217;t have done it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sorry. There, I&#8217;ve apologised, make
friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing to make friends about,&#8221; she
replied stiffly. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to shake hands&mdash;I&#8217;m
not angry, let us go into the house.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Silas imploringly. &#8220;He and she are
sitting over that old album, comparing notes. I saw
them through the window, that&#8217;s why I came to look
for you in the garden. Do you know, I believe the
Governor was gone once on Maria, years ago, but
they never got married. He married my mother
instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl forgot her resentment.</p>
<p>The faint idea that Colonel Grangerson and
Maria Pinckney had perhaps been more than friends
in long gone days, had strayed across her mind, to be
dismissed as a fancy. It interested her to find Silas
confirming it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I can&#8217;t say for certain,&#8221; he went on,
lighting a cigarette. &#8220;I only judge by the way they
go on when they&#8217;re together, and the way he talks of
her. Say, do you ever want to grow old?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t&mdash;ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither do I. I hope I&#8217;ll be kicked to death by
a horse, or drowned or shot before I&#8217;m forty. I
don&#8217;t want to die in any beds with doctors round me.
I reckon if I&#8217;m ever like that I&#8217;ll drink the liniment
instead of the medicine&mdash;same as I nearly drenched
Pap&mdash;and go to heaven with a red label for my
ticket. Sit down for a while and let&#8217;s talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t care to sit down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t touch you. I promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl hesitated a moment and then sat down. She
was not afraid of Silas in the least, but his tricks of
an overgrown boy did not please her; it seemed to
her sometimes as though his irresponsibility was less
an inheritance from youth, than from some ancestor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
ill-balanced to the point of craziness. If any other
man of his age had acted and spoken to her as he had
done she would have smacked his face, but Silas was
Silas, and his good looks and seeming innocence, and
something really charming that lay away at the back
of his character and gave colour to this personality,
managed, somehow, to condone his queerness of conduct.</p>
<p>All the same she sat a foot away from him on the
seat, and kept her hands folded on her lap.</p>
<p>Silas sat for a while smoking in silence, then he
spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s this you said you came from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ireland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t talk like a Paddy a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit, nor look like one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen many Irish people?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, mostly in pictures&mdash;comic papers, you know,
like <i>Puck</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a shame,&#8221; broke out Phyl. &#8220;People
are always making fun of the Irish, drawing them
like monkeys with great upper lips&mdash;but it&#8217;s only
ignorant people who never travel who think of them
like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, I expect,&#8221; replied Silas, either unconscious
of the dig at himself or undesirous of a quarrel,
&#8220;and the next few dollars I have to spare I&#8217;ll go
to Ireland. I&#8217;m crazy now to see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s made you crazy to see it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s the place you come from.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl sniffed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hate compliments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t complimenting you, I was complimenting
Ireland,&#8221; said Silas sweetly. She was silent, a white
moth passing close to her held her gaze for a
moment, then it flitted away across the bushes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s forget Ireland for a moment,&#8221; said she,
&#8220;and talk of Charleston. Do you know many people
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know most every one. The Pinckneys and
Calhouns and Tredegars and Revenalls and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rhetts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;but there are a dozen Rhetts; same as
there&#8217;s half a hundred Pinckneys and Calhouns,
families, I mean. What&#8217;s his name&mdash;Richard
Pinckney, your guardian, is engaged to a Rhett.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is&mdash;Venetia Frances, the one that lives in
Legare Street. Why, I&#8217;ve seen them canoodling
often, and every one says they are engaged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s not, or Miss Pinckney would have told
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s blind. I tell you he is, and she&#8217;ll be
your guardian when he&#8217;s married her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That she won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;ll you help it? A man and wife are one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s only guardian of my property.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Heaven help your property when she gets
a finger in the pie; she&#8217;ll spend it on hats&mdash;sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>This outrageous statement, uttered with a laugh,
left Phyl cold. The statement about Frances Rhett
had disturbed her, she could not tell exactly why, for
it was none of her business whom Pinckney might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
choose to marry&mdash;still&mdash;Frances Rhett! It was
almost as though an antagonism had existed between
them since that afternoon when she had seen Frances
first, driving in the car with Richard Pinckney.</p>
<p>She rose to her feet and Silas rose also, throwing
away the end of his cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going into the house?&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll be off to-morrow morning, and I
won&#8217;t see you, for I have to be out early, but I&#8217;ll see
you in Charleston, though not at Vernons maybe, for
I&#8217;m not in love with Richard Pinckney, and I don&#8217;t
care much for visiting his house. But I&#8217;ll see you
somewhere, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; said she holding out her hand. He
took it, held it, and then, all of a sudden, she found
herself in his arms.</p>
<p>Helpless as a child, in his arms and smothered
with kisses. He kissed her on the mouth, on the
forehead, on the chin, and with a last kiss on the
mouth that made her feel as though her life were
going from her, he vanished. Vanished amidst the
bushes whilst she stood, tottering, dazed, breathless,
outraged, yet&mdash;in some extraordinary way not angry.
Pulled between tears and laughter, resentment, and
a strange new feeling suddenly born in her from his
burning lips, and the strength that had held her for a
moment to itself.</p>
<p>In one moment, and as though with the stroke of
a sword, Silas had cut down the barrier that had
divided her from the reality of things. He had
kissed away her childhood.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>Then throwing out her hands as though pushing
away some presence that was surrounding her, she
ran to the house. In the hall she sat down for a
moment to recover herself before going into the
drawing room, where Miss Pinckney and the Colonel
were closing the book which held for them the people
and the places they had known in youth, and between
its leaves who knows what old remembrances, like
the withered flower that has once formed part of a
summer&#8217;s day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p>They started at ten o&#8217;clock next morning for
Charleston, the Colonel standing on the house
steps and waving his hand to them as they drove off.
Silas was nowhere to be seen, he had gone out before
breakfast, so the butler said, and had not returned.
Miss Pinckney resented this casual treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to have been here to bid us good-bye,&#8221;
said she, as they cleared the avenue. &#8220;He&#8217;s got the
name for being a mad creature, but even mad creatures
may show common courtesy. I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t
know where he gets his manners from unless it&#8217;s
his mother&#8217;s lot, same place as he got his good
looks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say he&#8217;s mad?&#8221; asked Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he is. Not exactly mad, maybe, but
eccentric, he swum Charleston harbour with his
clothes on because some one dared him, and was
nearly drowned with the tide coming in or going out,
I forget which; and another day he got on the engine
at Charleston station and started the train,
drove it too, till they managed to climb over the top
of the carriages or something and stop him&mdash;at least
that&#8217;s the story. He&#8217;ll come to a bad end, that boy,
unless he mends his ways. Lots of people say he&#8217;s
got good in him. So he has, perhaps, but it&#8217;s just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
that sort that come to the worst end, unless the good
manages to fight the bad and get it under in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl said nothing. Her mind was disturbed.
She had slept scarcely at all during the night, and
her feelings towards Silas Grangerson, now that she
was beyond his reach, were alternating in the
strangest way between attraction and repulsion.</p>
<p>They would have repelled the thought of him
entirely but for the instinctive recognition of the
fact that his conduct had been the result of impulse,
the impulse of a child, ill governed, and accustomed
to seize what it wanted. Added to that was the fact
of his entire naturalness. From the moment of
their first meeting he had talked to her as though
they were old acquaintances. Unless when talking
to his father, everything in his manner, tone, conversation
was free, unfettered by convention, fresh,
if at times startling. This was his great charm,
and at the same time his great defect, for it revealed
his want of qualities no less than his qualities.</p>
<p>Do what she could she was unable to escape from
the incident of last night, it was as though those
strong arms had not quite released their hold upon
her, as though Pan had broken from the bushes,
shown her by his magic things she had never
dreamed of, and vanished.</p>
<p>It was nearly two o&#8217;clock when they reached Vernons.
Richard Pinckney was at home, and at the
sight of him Phyl&#8217;s heart went out towards him.
Clean, well groomed, honest, kindly, he was like a
breath of fresh sea air after breathing tropical
swamp atmosphere.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>Strange to say Miss Pinckney seemed to feel
somewhat the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;re back,&#8221; said she, as they passed into
the dining-room where some refreshments were
awaiting them, &#8220;and glad I am to be back. Vernons
smells good after Grangersons. Oh, dear me, what
is it that clings to that place? It&#8217;s like opening an
old trunk that&#8217;s been shut for years. I told Seth
Grangerson, right out flat, he ought to get away
from there into the world somewhere, but there he
sits clinging to his rheumatism and the past. I declare
I nearly cried last night as he was showing me
all those old pictures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not very ill then,&#8221; said Richard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ill! Not he. It was that fool Silas sent the
telegram. Just an attack of rheumatism.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went upstairs to change and the two young
people went into the garden, where Richard Pinckney
was having some alterations done.</p>
<p>On the day Phyl&#8217;s hair went up it seemed to Richard
that a new person had come to live with them.
Phyl had suddenly turned into a young woman&mdash;and
such a young woman! He had never considered
her looks before, to young men of his age and
temperament girls in pigtails are, as far as the manhood
in them is concerned, little more and sometimes
less than things. But Phyl with her hair up was
not to be denied, and had he not been philandering
after Frances Rhett, and had Phyl been a total
stranger suddenly seen, it is quite possible that a far
warmer feeling than admiration might have been the
result. As it was she formed a new interest in life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>He showed her the alterations he was making,
slight enough and causing little change in the general
plan of the garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;I scarcely like doing anything,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but that
new walk will be no end of an improvement, and it
will save that bit of grass which is being trodden to
death by people crossing it, then there&#8217;s all those
bushes by the gate, they&#8217;re going, those behind the
tree,&mdash;a little space there will make all the difference
in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Behind the magnolia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they have been there always and&mdash;well,
look!&#8221;</p>
<p>She led the way behind the tree, pushed the
bushes aside and disclosed the seat.</p>
<p>She no longer felt that she was betraying a secret.
Her experience at Grangersons had in some way
made Vernons seem to her now really her home,
and Richard Pinckney closer to her in relationship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, how did you know that was there?&#8221; said
Richard. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Juliet Mascarene used to sit there with&mdash;with
some one she was in love with. I found some of
her old letters and they told about it&mdash;see, it&#8217;s a
little arbour, used to be, though it&#8217;s all so overgrown
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Juliet,&#8221; said he. &#8220;That was the girl who died.
I have heard Aunt Maria talk about her and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
keeps her room just as it used to be. Who was the
somebody?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a Mr. Rupert Pinckney.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew there was a love story of some sort connected
with her, but I never worried about the details.
So they used to come and sit here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;d come to the gate at night and she&#8217;d
meet him. Her people did not want her to marry
him and so they had to meet in secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a long time ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you were born,&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>He looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt is always saying how like you are to her,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;but she&#8217;s mad on family likenesses, and I
never thought of it. It may be a want in me but I&#8217;ve
never taken much interest in dead relatives; but
somehow, finding this little place tucked away here
gives one a jog. It&#8217;s like finding a nest in a tree.
How long have you known of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, some time. I found a bundle of her old
letters&mdash;&#8221; she paused. Richard Pinckney had taken
his place on the little seat, just as one sits down in
an armchair to see if it is comfortable, and was
leaning back amidst the bush branches.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is all right,&#8221; said he, &#8220;sit down, there&#8217;s lots
of room&mdash;you found her letter, tell us all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl sat down and told the little story. It
seemed to interest him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Pinckneys lost money,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and that&#8217;s
why the old Mascarene birds were set against her
marrying him, I suppose. Makes one wild that sort
of thing. What right have people to interfere?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Money seems everything in this world,&#8221; said
Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not&mdash;it seems to be, but it&#8217;s not. Money
can&#8217;t buy happiness after one is grown up. You
remember I told you that over in Ireland; when
candy and fishing rods mean happiness money is all
right&mdash;after that money is useful enough, but it&#8217;s the
making of it and not the spending it that counts,&mdash;that
and a lot of things that have nothing to do with
money. If the Mascarenes hadn&#8217;t been fools they&#8217;d
have seen that a poor man with kick in him&mdash;and the
Pinckneys always had that&mdash;was as good as a rich
man, and those two might have got married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Phyl, &#8220;they never could have got
married, he had to die. He was killed, you know,
at the beginning of the war.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a fatalist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, things happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but you can stop them happening very
often.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just by willing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Phyl meditatively, &#8220;but how are you
to use your will against what comes unexpectedly.
Now that telegram yesterday morning took me to
Grangersons with Miss Pinckney. Suppose&mdash;suppose
I had broken my leg or, say, fallen into a well
there and got drowned&mdash;that would have been
Fate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Pinckney, &#8220;carelessness, the telegram
would not have drowned you, but your carelessness
in going too close to the well.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; said Phyl, &#8220;instead of that, Mr. Silas
Grangerson had shot me by accident with a gun&mdash;the
telegram would have brought me to that without
any carelessness of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Pinckney lightly, &#8220;it would
still have been your own fault for going near such
a hare-brained scamp. Oh, I&#8217;m only joking, what
I really mean is that nine times out of ten the thing
people call Fate is nothing more than want of foresight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the tenth time it is Fate,&#8221; said Phyl rising.</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p>Next morning brought Phyl a letter. It came
by the early post, so that she got it in her
bedroom before coming down.</p>
<p>Phyl had few correspondents and she looked at
the envelope curiously before opening it.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Miss Berknowles,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>at Vernons. Charleston.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>ran the address written in a large, boyish, yet individual
hand. She knew at once and by instinct
whom it was from.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming to Charleston in a day or two, and
I want to see you,&#8221; ran the letter which had neither
address nor date, &#8220;but I&#8217;m not coming to Pinckneys.
I&#8217;ll be about town and sure to find you somewhere.
I can&#8217;t get you out of my mind since last night.
Tried to, but can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all. Phyl put the letter back in its
envelope. She was not angry, she was disturbed.
There was an assurance about Silas Grangerson
daunting in its simplicity and directness. Something
that raised opposition to him in her heart, yet
paralysed it. Instinct told her to avoid him, to
drive him from her mind, ay and something more
than instinct. The spirit of Vernons, the calm sweet
soul of the place, that seemed to hold the past and
the present, Juliet and herself, peace and happiness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
with the promise of all good things in the future,
this spirit rose up against Silas Grangerson as
though he were the antagonist to happiness and
peace, Juliet and herself, the present and the past.</p>
<p>Rose up, without prevailing entirely.</p>
<p>Silas had impressed himself upon her mind in
such a manner that she could not free herself from
the impression. Young as she was, with the terribly
clear perception of the male character which
all women possess in different degrees, she recognised
that Silas was dangerous to that logical and
equitable state of existence we call happiness, not on
account of his wildness or his eccentricities, but because
of some want inherent in his nature, something
that spoke vaguely in his words and his actions, in
his handsome face and in his careless and graceful
manner.</p>
<p>All the same she could not free herself from the
impression he had made upon her, she could not
drive him from her mind, he had in some way
paralysed her volition, called forces to his aid from
some unknown part of her nature, perhaps with
those kisses which she still felt upon the very face
of her soul.</p>
<p>She came down to breakfast, and afterwards
finding herself alone with Miss Pinckney, she took
Silas&#8217;s letter from her pocket and handed it to her.
She had been debating in her own mind all breakfast
time as to whether she ought to show the letter;
the struggle had been between her instinct to do the
right thing, and a powerful antagonism to this instinct
which was a new thing in her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>The latter won.</p>
<p>And then, lo and behold, when she found herself
alone with Miss Pinckney in the sunlit breakfast
room, almost against her will and just as though
her hand had moved of its own volition, she put it
in her pocket and produced the letter.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney read it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of all the crazy creatures!&#8221; said she.
&#8220;Why, he has only met you once. He&#8217;s mad! No,
he isn&#8217;t&mdash;he&#8217;s a Grangerson. I know them.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped short and re-read the letter, turned it
about and then laid it down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as if he&#8217;d known you for years. And you
scarcely spoke to him. Did he <i>say</i> anything to you
as if he cared for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Phyl quite truthfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he look at you as if he cared for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the other, dreading another question.
But Miss Pinckney did not put it. She could
not conceive a man kissing a girl who had never
betrayed his feelings for her by word or glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it gets me. It does indeed; acting like a
dumb creature and then writing this&mdash; Do you care
for <i>him</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;no&mdash;you see, I don&#8217;t know him&mdash;much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he seems to know you pretty well, there&#8217;s
no doubt about one thing, Silas Grangerson can
make up his mind pretty quick. He won&#8217;t come to
Vernons, won&#8217;t he? Well, maybe it&#8217;s better for him
not, for I&#8217;ve no patience with oddities. That&#8217;s
what&#8217;s wrong with him, he&#8217;s an oddity, and it&#8217;s those
sort of people make the trouble in life&mdash;they&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
worse than whisky and cards for bringing unhappiness.
Years and years and years ago&mdash;I&#8217;m telling
you this though I&#8217;ve never told it to any one else&mdash;Seth
Grangerson, Silas&#8217;s father, seemed to care for
me, not much, still he seemed to care. Then one
day all at once he came into the room where I was,
through the window, and told me to come off and
get married to him, wanted me to go away right off.
I was a fool in those days, but not all a fool, and
when he tried to put his arm round my waist, my
hand went up and smacked his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are good enough friends now, but I&#8217;ve often
thought of what I escaped by not marrying him.
You saw him and the life he&#8217;s leading at that out
of the way place, but you didn&#8217;t see his obstinacy
and his queerness, and Silas is ten times worse, more
crazy&mdash;well, there, you&#8217;re warned&mdash;but mind you I
don&#8217;t want to be meddling. I&#8217;ve seen so many carefully
prepared marriages turn out pure miseries, and
so many crazy matches turn out happily, that I&#8217;m
more than cautious in giving advice. Seems to me
that people before they are married are quite different
creatures to what they turn out after they are
married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to get married,&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but, seems to me, Silas does,&#8221; replied the
other.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p>One bright morning three days later, as Phyl
was crossing Meeting Street near the Charleston
Hotel, whom should she meet but Silas.</p>
<p>Silas in town get up, quite a different looking individual
from the Silas of Grangersons, dressed in
perfectly fitting light grey tweed, a figure almost
condoning one for the use of that old-time, half-discredited
word &#8220;Elegant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are,&#8221; said Silas, his face lighting
up. &#8220;I thought it wouldn&#8217;t be long before I met
you. Meeting Street is like a rabbit run, and I
reckon the whole of Charleston passes through it
twice a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>His manner was genuinely frank and open, and
he seemed to have completely forgotten the incident
of the kissing. Phyl said nothing for a moment;
she felt put out, angry at having been caught
like a rabbit, and not over pleased at being compared
to one.</p>
<p>Then she spoke freezingly enough:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know much about the habits of Charleston;
you will not find <i>me</i> here every day. I have
only been out twice here alone and&mdash;I&#8217;m in a hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; cried Silas
in a voice of astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But there is, you&#8217;re not angry with me, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; replied the other, quite determined
to avoid being drawn into explanations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s all right. You don&#8217;t mind my walking
with you a bit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only came here last night, and I&#8217;m putting up
at the Charleston,&#8221; said Silas. &#8220;Of course there
are a lot of friends I could stay with but I always
prefer being free; one is never quite free in another
person&#8217;s house; for one thing you can&#8217;t order the
servants about, though, upon my word, now-a-days
one can&#8217;t do that, much, anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose not,&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>The fact was being borne in upon her that Silas
in town was a different person from Silas in the
country, or seemed so; more sedate and more conventional.
She also noticed as they walked along
that he was saluted by a great many people, and also,
before she had done with him that morning, she
noticed that the leery, impudent looking, coloured
folk seemed to come under a blight as they passed
him, giving him the wall and yards to spare. It
was as though the impersonification of the blacksnake
whip were walking with her as well as a most
notoriously dangerous man, a man who would strike
another down, white or coloured, for a glance, not
to say a word.</p>
<p>She had come out on business, commissioned by
Miss Pinckney to purchase a ball of magenta Berlin
wool. Miss Pinckney still knitted antimacassars,
and the construction of antimacassars is impossible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
without Berlin wool&mdash;that obsolete form of German
Frightfulness.</p>
<p>She bestowed the things on poor folk to brighten
their homes.</p>
<p>When Phyl went into the store to buy the wool
Silas waited outside, and when she came out they
walked down the street together.</p>
<p>She had intended returning straight home after
making her purchase but they were walking now
not towards Vernons but towards the Battery.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you do with yourself all day?&#8221; asked
Silas, suddenly breaking silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;nothing much&mdash;we
go out for drives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In that old basket carriage thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Miss Pinckney.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, I&#8217;ve seen her often&mdash;what else do you
do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I read.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you read?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Books.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t Pinckney ever take you out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t go out much with Mr. Pinckney;
you see, he&#8217;s generally so busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silas sniffed. They had reached the Battery and
were standing looking over the blue water of the
harbour. The day was perfect, dreamy, heavenly,
warm and filled with sea scents and harbour sounds;
scarcely a breath of wind stirred across the water
where a three-master was being towed to her moorings
by a tug.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s coming up to the wharves,&#8221; said Silas.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
&#8220;They steer by the spire of St. Philips, the line between
there and Fort Sumpter is all deep water.
How&#8217;d you like to be a sailor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t mind,&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you like to take a boat&mdash;I mean a decent
sized fishing yawl and go off round the world,
or even down Florida way? Florida&#8217;s fine, you
don&#8217;t know Florida, it&#8217;s got two coasts and it&#8217;s hard
to tell which is the best. From Indian River right
round and up to Cedar Keys there&#8217;s all sorts of fishing,
and you can camp out on the reefs; one cooks
one&#8217;s own food and you can swim all day. There&#8217;s
tarpon and barracuda and sword fish, and nights
when there&#8217;s a moon you could see to read a book.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How jolly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just you and I. I&#8217;m fed up with everything.
We could have a boatman to help sail and
steer.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke lightly and laughingly, and without
much enthusiasm and as though he were talking to
some one of his own sex, and Phyl, not knowing how
to take him, said nothing.</p>
<p>He went on, his tone growing warmer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not joking, I&#8217;m dead sick of Grangersons
and Charleston, and I reckon you are too&mdash;aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may think so, but you are, all the same,
without knowing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you are talking nonsense,&#8221; said Phyl hurriedly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
fighting against a deadly sort of paralysis
of mind such as one may suppose comes upon the
mind of a bird under the spell of a serpent.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one could be kinder than Miss Pinckney, and
so no one could be happier than I am. I love
Vernons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same,&#8221; said Silas, &#8220;you are not really
alive there. It&#8217;s the life of a cabbage, must be,
there&#8217;s only you and Maria and&mdash;Pinckney. Maria
is a decent old sort but she&#8217;s only a woman, and
as for Pinckney&mdash;he doesn&#8217;t care for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>This statement suddenly brought Phyl to herself.
It went through her like a knife. She had ceased
to think of Richard Pinckney in any way but as a
friend. At one time, during the first couple of days
at Vernons, her heart had moved mysteriously towards
him; the way he had connected himself
through Prue&#8217;s message with the love story of
Juliet had drawn her towards him, but that spell
had snapped; she was conscious only of friendliness
towards Richard Pinckney. Why, then, this sudden
pain caused by Silas&#8217;s words?</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; she flashed out. &#8220;What
right have you to dare&mdash;&#8221; She stopped.</p>
<p>The blaze of her anger seemed to Silas evidence
that she cared for Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in love with him,&#8221; said he, flying out.
The bald and brutal statement took Phyl&#8217;s breath
from her. She turned on him, saw the anger in his
face, and then&mdash;turned away.</p>
<p>His state of mind condoned his words. To a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
woman a blow received from the passion she has
roused is a rude sort of compliment, unlike other
compliments it is absolutely honest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am in love with no one,&#8221; said she; &#8220;you have
no right to say such things&mdash;no right at all&mdash;they
are insulting.&#8221;</p>
<p>A gull, white as snow, came flitting by and wheeled
out away over the harbour; as her eyes followed it
he stood looking at her, his anger gone, but his mind
only half convinced by her feeble words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to insult you,&#8221; he said; &#8220;don&#8217;t let
us quarrel. When I&#8217;m in a temper I don&#8217;t know
what I say or do&mdash;that&#8217;s the truth. I want to have
you all for myself, have ever since the first moment
I saw you over there at Grangersons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Phyl. &#8220;I can&#8217;t listen to you if you
talk like that&mdash;Please don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Silas.</p>
<p>The quick change that was one of his characteristics
showed itself in his altered voice. His was a
mind that seemed always in ambush, darting out on
predatory expeditions and then vanishing back into
obscurity.</p>
<p>They turned away from the sea front and began
to retrace their steps, silently at first, and then little
by little falling into ordinary conversation again as
though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Silas knew every corner of Charleston, and the
history of every corner, and when he chose he could
make his knowledge interesting. In this mood he
was a pleasant companion, and Phyl, her recent experience
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
almost forgotten, let herself be led and instructed,
not knowing that this armistice was the
equivalent of a defeat.</p>
<p>She had already drawn much closer to him in
mind, this companionship and quiet conversation
was a more sure and deadly thing than any kisses
or wild words. It would linger in her mind warm
and quietly. Put in a woman&#8217;s mind a pleasant
recollection of yourself and you have established a
force whose activity may seem small, but is in reality
great, because of its permanency.</p>
<p>They did not take a direct line in the direction of
Vernons, and so presently found themselves in front
of St. Michael&#8217;s. The gate of the cemetery was
open and they wandered in.</p>
<p>The place was deserted, save by the birds, and
the air perfumed by all manner of Southern growing
things. Sun, shadow, silence, and that strange
peace which hangs over the homes of the dead, all
were here, ringed in by the old walls and the faint
murmur of the living city beyond.</p>
<p>They walked along the paths, looking at the
tombstones, and pausing to read the inscriptions,
Phyl gradually entering into that state of mind
wherein reality and material things fall out of perspective.
The fragrant elusive poetry of death,
which can speak in the songs of birds and the scent
of flowers in the sunshine and the shade of trees
more clearly than in the voice of man, was speaking
to her now.</p>
<p>All these people here lying, all these names here
inscribed, all these were the representatives of days
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
once bright and now forgotten, love once sweet and
now unknown.</p>
<p>Then, as though something had led or betrayed
her to the place, she paused where the graves lay
half shadowed by a magnolia, she read the nearest
inscription with a little catch of her breath. Then
the further one. They were the graves of Juliet
Mascarene and Rupert Pinckney, the dead lovers
who had passed from the world almost together,
whose bodies lay side by side in the cold bed of
earth.</p>
<p>In a moment the spell of the little arbour was
around her again, in a moment the pregnant first
impression of Vernons had re-seized her, fresh as
though the commonplace touch of everyday life had
never spoiled it.</p>
<p>It was as though the spirit of Juliet and the spirit
of the old house were saying to her &#8220;Have you forgotten
us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tears welled to her eyes. Silas standing beside
her was saying something, she did not know what.
She scarcely heard him.</p>
<p>Misinterpreting her silence, unconscious as an
animal of her state of mind and the direction of her
thoughts, the man at her side moved towards her
slightly, seemed to hesitate, and then, suddenly
clasping her by the waist kissed her upon the side of
the neck.</p>
<p>Phyl straightened like a bow when the string is
released. Then she struck him, struck him open
handed in the face, so that the sound of the blow
might have been heard beyond the wall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>His face blanched so that the mark on it showed
up, he took a step back. For a moment Phyl
thought he was going to spring upon her. Then he
mastered himself, but if murder ever showed itself
upon the countenance of man it showed itself in
that half second on the countenance of Silas Grangerson.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be sorry for that,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak to me,&#8221; said Phyl. &#8220;You are horrible&mdash;bad&mdash;wicked&mdash;I
will tell Richard Pinckney.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; said Silas. &#8220;Tell him also I&#8217;ll be even
with him yet. You&#8217;re in love with him, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s
the matter with you&mdash;well, wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned on his heel and walked off. He did
not look back once. As he vanished from sight
Phyl clasped her hands together.</p>
<p>It was as though she had suddenly been shown
the real Silas&mdash;or rather the something light and
evil and dangerous, the something inscrutable and
allied to insanity that inhabited his mind.</p>
<p>She was not thinking of herself, she was thinking
of Richard Pinckney. She felt that she had been
the unconscious means of releasing against him an
evil force. A force that might injure or destroy
him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p>She came out of the cemetery. There was no
sign of Silas in the street nor on the front of the
church.</p>
<p>Phyl had a full measure of the Celtic power to
meet trouble halfway, to imagine disaster. As she
hurried home she saw all manner of trouble, things
happening to Richard Pinckney, and all brought
about through herself. Amidst all these fancies she
saw one fact: He must be warned.</p>
<p>She found Miss Pinckney in the linen room. The
linen room at Vernons was a treasure house beyond
a man&#8217;s description, perhaps even beyond his true appreciation.
There in the cupboards with their thin
old fashioned ring handles and on the shelves of red
cedar reposed damask and double damask of the
time when men paid for their purchases in guineas,
miraculous preservations. Just as the life of a
china vase is a perpetual escape from the stupidity
of servant maids and the heaviness of clumsy fingers,
so the life of these cream white oblongs, in which
certain lights brought forth miraculous representations
of flowers, festoons and birds, was a perpetual
preservation from the moth, from damp, from dryness,
from the dust that corrupts.</p>
<p>A house like Vernons exists not by virtue of its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
brick and mortar; to keep it really alive it must be
preserved in all its parts, not only from damp and
decay, but from innovation; one can fancy a gas
cooker sending a perpetual shudder through it, a
telephone destroying who knows what fragrant old
influences; the store cupboards and still room are
part of its bowels, its napery, bed sheets, and hangings
part of its dress. The man knew what he was
doing who left Miss Pinckney a life interest in
Vernons, it was that interest that kept Vernons
alive.</p>
<p>She was exercising it on the critical examination
of some sheets when Phyl came into the room, now,
with the wool she had purchased and the tale she
had to tell.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney carefully put the sheet she was
examining on one side, opened the parcel and looked
at the wool.</p>
<p>&#8220;I met Silas Grangerson,&#8221; said Phyl as the other
was examining the purchase with head turned on
one side, holding it now in this light, now in that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Silas Grangerson! Why, where on earth has he
sprung from?&#8221; asked Miss Pinckney in a voice of
surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I met him in the street and we
walked as far as the Battery and&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated for a moment, then it all came out.
To no one but Maria Pinckney could she have told
that story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of all the astounding creatures,&#8221; said Miss
Pinckney at last. &#8220;Did he ask you to marry him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just to run away with him&mdash;kissed you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He kissed me at Grangersons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At Grangersons. When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That night. I went into the garden and he
came out from amongst some bushes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Umph&mdash; It&#8217;s the family disease&mdash; Well, if I
get my fingers in his hair I promise to cure him.
He wants curing. He&#8217;ll just apologise, and that
before he&#8217;s an hour older. Where&#8217;s he staying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Phyl, &#8220;you mustn&#8217;t ever say I told
you. I don&#8217;t mind. I would have said nothing
only for Mr. Pinckney.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Richard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has he to do with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl did not hesitate nor turn her head away,
though her cheeks were burning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Silas Grangerson thinks I care for Mr. Pinckney,
he said he would be even with him. I know
he intends doing him some injury. I feel it&mdash;and I
want you to warn him to be careful&mdash;without telling
him, of course, what I have said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney was silent for a moment. She had
already matched Phyl and Richard in her mind.
She had come to a very full understanding of her
character, and she would have given all the linen
at Vernons for the certainty that those two cared
for one another.</p>
<p>Frances Rhett rode her like an obsession. Life
and nature had given Maria Pinckney an acquired
and instinctive knowledge of character, and in the
union of Richard and Frances Rhett she divined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
unhappiness, just as a clever seaman divines the unseen
ice-berg in the ship&#8217;s track. She smelt it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phyl,&#8221; said she, &#8220;do you care for Richard?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question quickly put and by those lips caused
no confusion in the girl&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said she. &#8220;At least&mdash; Oh, I don&#8217;t know
how to explain it&mdash;I care for everything here, for
Vernons and everything in it, it is all like a story
that I love&mdash;Juliet and Vernons and the past and
the present. He&#8217;s part of it too. I want to have
it always just as it is. I didn&#8217;t tell you, but when
that happened in the cemetery, I was looking at her
grave; you never told me it was there with his. I
came on it by accident and she was seeming to speak
to me out of it. I was thinking of her and him,
when&mdash;that happened. It was just as though some
one had struck <i>her</i> and him. I can&#8217;t explain exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strange,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney.</p>
<p>She turned and began to put away with a thoughtful
air the linen she had been examining. Then she
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell Richard and warn him to keep away
from that fool, not that there is any danger&mdash;but it
is just as well to warn him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl helped to put away the linen and then she
went upstairs to her room. She felt easier in her
mind and taking her seat on a cane couch by the
window she fell into a book. The History of the
Civil War. This bookworm had always one sure
refuge in trouble&mdash;books.</p>
<p>Books! Have we ever properly recognised the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
mystery and magic that lies in that word, the magic
that allows a man to lead ever so many other lives
than his own, to be other people, to travel where
he has never been, to laugh with folk he has never
seen, to know their sorrows as he can never know
the sorrows of &#8220;real people&#8221;&mdash;and their joys.</p>
<p>Phyl had been Robinson Crusoe and Jane Eyre,

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p>After luncheon that day Phyl, having nothing
better to do, went up to her room and resumed
her book.</p>
<p>Richard Pinckney had not come in to luncheon,
he rarely returned home for the meal, yet all the
same, his absence made her uneasy. Suppose Silas
Grangerson had met him&mdash;suppose they had fought?
She called to recollection Silas&#8217;s face just after she
had struck him, the insane malevolence in it, the
ugliness that had suddenly destroyed his good looks.
Silas was capable of anything, he would never forgive
that blow and he would try to return it, of that
she felt certain. He could not avenge himself on
her but he could on Richard. He imagined that
she cared for Richard Pinckney. Did she? The
question came to her again in Miss Pinckney&#8217;s voice&mdash;she
did not even try to answer it. As though it
irritated her, she tossed the book she was holding
in her hand to the floor and lay with her eyes fixed
on the lace window curtains that were moving
slightly to the almost imperceptible stirring of the
air from outside.</p>
<p>Beyond the curtains lay the golden afternoon.
Sometimes a bird shadow, the loveliest thing in
shadow-land, would cross the curtains, sometimes a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
note of song or the sound of a bird&#8217;s flight from
tree to tree would tell that there was a garden down
below. The street beyond the garden and the city
beyond the street could be heard, but were little
more evident to the senses than those things in a
picture which we guess but cannot see.</p>
<p>Phyl, allowing her mind to be led by these faint
and fugitive sounds, fell into a reverie. Then she
fell asleep and straight way began to dream.</p>
<p>She dreamed that Miss Pinckney was in the room
moving about dusting things, a duster in one hand,
an open letter in the other. There was troublous
news of some sort in the letter, but what it was
Miss Pinckney would not say. Then the room
turned into the piazza, where Juliet Mascarene was
standing with her hands on the rail, looking down
on the garden.</p>
<p>She seemed to know Juliet quite well and was not
a bit surprised to see her there; she touched her but
she did not turn. Phyl slipped her arm round
Juliet&#8217;s waist and stood with her looking at the
garden, and as they stood thus the most curious
dream feeling came upon her, a feeling of duality,
Juliet was herself, she was Juliet. Then as this
feeling died away Juliet vanished and she was standing
alone on the piazza.</p>
<p>Then she half woke, falling asleep again to be
awakened fully by a sound.</p>
<p>A sound, deep, sonorous, now rhythmical, now
confused. It was the sound of guns.</p>
<p>She had heard it once long ago on the Brighton
coast, and now as she sat up every nerve and muscle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
tense, and her mind filled with a vague dread, it
came so heavily that the walls of Vernons shook.</p>
<p>She ran on to the piazza. There was no one
there. The garden gate was wide open, there was
no one in the garden, and she noticed, though without
any astonishment, that some one had been at
work in the garden altering the paths. A white
butterfly was flittering above the flowers, and a red
bird leaving the magnolia tree by the gate, flew, a
splash of colour, across to the garden beyond.</p>
<p>These things she saw but did not heed. She was
under the spell of the guns, the sound rose against
the brightness of the day as a black cloud rises
across the sky or a sorrow across one&#8217;s life, insistent,
rhythmical, a pall of sound now billowing, now
sinking, as though blown under by a wind.</p>
<p>She sought the piazza stairs and next moment
was in the garden, then she found herself in the
street.</p>
<p>Meeting Street was almost deserted. On the opposite
side two stout, elderly and rather quaintly
dressed gentlemen were walking along in the direction
of the station, but away down towards the
Charleston Hotel there was a crowd.</p>
<p>The sight of this crowd filled her with terror, a
terror remote from reason, an impersonal terror, as
though the deadliest peril were threatening not herself
but all things and everything she loved.</p>
<p>She ran, and as she drew close to the striving
mass of people she saw men bearing stretchers.</p>
<p>They were pushing their way through the crowd,
making to enter a house on the right.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>Then came a voice. The voice of one man shouting
to another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young Pinckney&#8217;s killed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words pierced her like a sword, she felt herself
falling. Falling through darkness to unconsciousness,
from which she awoke to find herself
lying on the cane couch in her room.</p>
<p>She sat up.</p>
<p>The curtains were still stirring gently to the faint
wind from outside, on the floor lay the history of
the Civil War open just as she had cast it there
before falling asleep. The sound of the guns had
ceased, and nothing was to be heard but the stray
accustomed sounds of the city and the street.</p>
<p>She struggled to her feet and came out on the
piazza. The garden gate was closed and the garden
was unaltered. She had dreamt all that, then.</p>
<p>For a minute she tried to persuade herself that it
was a dream, then she gave up the attempt. That
was no dream. Everything in it was four square.
She could still see the shadows of the two gentlemen
who had been walking on the other side of the
street, shadows cast clearly before them by the sun.</p>
<p>The first part of her experience had been a dream,
all that about Miss Pinckney and Juliet. But right
from the sound of the guns all had been reality.
She had seen, touched, heard.</p>
<p>Glancing back into the room she saw the book
lying on the floor, the sight of it was like a crystallising
thread for thought.</p>
<p>She had seen the past, she had heard the guns of
the war.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>She went back into the room and took her seat
on the couch and held her head between her hands.
She recalled the terror that told her that everything
she loved was in danger. When the man had cried
out that young Pinckney was killed, it was the
thought of the death of Richard Pinckney that
struck her into unconsciousness. Yet she knew that
what she had seen was the day of the death of
Rupert Pinckney, that one of those figures carried
on the stretchers was his figure, that her grief was
for him.</p>
<p>Had she then experienced what Juliet once experienced,
seen what she saw, suffered what she suffered?</p>
<p>Was she Juliet?</p>
<p>The thought had approached her vaguely before
this, so vaguely and so stealthily that she had not
really perceived it. It stood before her now frankly
in the full light of her mind.</p>
<p>Was she Juliet, and was Richard Rupert Pinckney?
She recalled that evening in Ireland when
she had heard his voice for the first time, and the
thrill of recognition that had passed through her,
how, at the Druids&#8217; Altar that night she had heard
her name called by his voice, the feeling in Dublin
that something was drawing her towards America.
Her feelings when she had first entered Meeting
Street and the garden of Vernons, Miss Pinckney&#8217;s
surprise at her likeness to Juliet. Prue&#8217;s recognition
of her, the finding of those letters, the finding
of the little arbour&mdash;any one of these things meant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
little in itself, taken all together they meant a great
deal&mdash;and then this last experience.</p>
<p>Her mind like a bird caught in a trap made frantic
efforts to escape from the bars placed around it
by conclusion; the idea seemed hateful, monstrous,
viewed as reality. Fateful too, for that feeling of
terror in the vision had all the significance of a
warning.</p>
<p>Then as she sat fighting against the unnatural,
her imaginative and superstitious mind trembling at
that which seemed beyond imagination, a miracle
happened.</p>
<p>The thought of danger to Richard Pinckney
brought it about. All at once fear vanished, the
fantastic clouds surrounding her broke, faded, passing,
showing the blue sky, and Truth stood before
her in the form of Love.</p>
<p>It was as though the vision had brought it to her
wrapped up in that terror she had felt for him. In
a moment the fantasy of Juliet became as nothing
beside the reality. If it were a thousand times true
that she had once been Juliet what did it matter?
She had loved Richard Pinckney always, so it
seemed to her, and nothing at all mattered beside
the recognition of that fact.</p>
<p>Perfect love casteth out fear, even fear of the
supernatural, even fear of Fate.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Richard,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney that night, finding
herself alone with him, &#8220;that Silas Grangerson is in
town and I want you to beware of him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Silas,&#8221; said he, &#8220;why I saw him at the club, he&#8217;s
gone back home by this, I expect, at least he said he
was going back to-night. Why should I beware of
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s such an irresponsible creature,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell you something, and mind,
what I&#8217;m going to tell you is a secret you mustn&#8217;t
breathe to any one: he&#8217;s in love with Phyl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Silas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I knew it wouldn&#8217;t be long before some
one was after her. She&#8217;s the prettiest girl in
Charleston, and she&#8217;s different from the others
somehow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cunning of the woman held her from praise
of Phyl&#8217;s goodness and mental qualities, or any over
praise of the goods she was bringing to his attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he spoken to her about it?&#8221; asked he.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure to goodness I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m
about telling you a thing that was told to me in confidence,&#8221;
said the other. &#8220;Well, you promise never
to say a word to Phyl or to any one else if I tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s&mdash;he&#8217;s kissed her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Richard Pinckney leaned forward in his chair.
He seemed very much disturbed in his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she care for him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe she does&mdash;yet. They always begin
like that; girls don&#8217;t know their minds till all of
a sudden they find some man who does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s hope she never cares for Silas Grangerson,&#8221;
said he rising from his chair. &#8220;You know
what he is.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>He left the room and went out on the piazza
where the girl was sitting. He sat down beside her
and they fell into talk.</p>
<p>Richard Pinckney&#8217;s mind was disturbed.</p>
<p>Only the day before he had proposed to Frances
Rhett and had been accepted. No one knew anything
of the engagement; they had decided to say
nothing about it for a while, but just keep it to
themselves. The trouble with Pinckney was that
Frances had, so to say, put the words of the proposal
into his mouth. Frances had flirted with
every man in Charleston; out of them all she had
chosen Pinckney as a permanent attaché, not because
she was in love with him but because he pleased
her best. She matched him against the others, as
a woman matches silk.</p>
<p>Pinckney had allowed himself to be led along;
there is nothing easier than to be led along by a
pretty woman. When the trap had closed on him
he recognised the fact without resenting it. He
was no longer a free man.</p>
<p>Phyl had told him this without speaking. For
some time past he had been admiring her, and yesterday
on returning in chains from Calhoun Street,
Phyl picking roses in the garden seemed to him the
prettiest picture he had seen for a long time, but it
did not give him pleasure; it stirred the first vague
uneasy recognition that his chains had wrought.
He had no right to look at any girl but Frances&mdash;and
he had been looking at her for a year without
the picture stirring any wild enthusiasm in his mind.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney&#8217;s revelation as to Silas had come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
to him as a blow. He could not tell what had hit
him or exactly where he had been hit. What did it
matter to him if a dozen men were in love with
Phyl? What right had he to feel injured? None,
yet he felt injured all the same.</p>
<p>As he sat by her now in the lamp-lit piazza, the
thought that would not leave his mind was the
thought that Silas had kissed her.</p>
<p>Behind the thought was the feeling of the boy
who sees the other boy going off with the ripest and
rosiest apple.</p>
<p>And Phyl was charming to-night. Something
seemed to have happened to her, increasing the
power of her personality, her voice seemed ever so
slightly changed, her manner was different.</p>
<p>This was a woman, distinct from the girl of yesterday,
as the full blown from the half blown flower.</p>
<p>They talked of trifles for a while, and then he
remembered something that he ought to have mentioned
before. The Rhetts were giving a dance
and they had sent an invitation to Phyl as well as
Miss Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be here by the morning post, I expect,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;You&#8217;d like to go, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl hesitated for a moment. &#8220;Is that&mdash;I mean
is that young lady Miss Frances Rhett&mdash;the one
who called here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; cut in Pinckney, &#8220;those are the people.
You&#8217;ll come, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Miss Pinckney going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&mdash;of course she&#8217;s going, she goes to everything,
and old Mrs. Rhett is anxious to meet you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is very kind of them,&#8221; said Phyl. &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll
come.&#8221; But she spoke without enthusiasm, and it
seemed to him that a chill had come over her.</p>
<p>Did she know of his entanglement with Frances
Rhett? And could it be&mdash;</p>
<p>He put the question aside. He had no right to
indulge in any fancies at all about Phyl as regarded
himself.</p>
<p>Then Miss Pinckney came out on the piazza and
Phyl rose to go into the house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p>When Silas Grangerson left the cemetery of
St. Michael&#8217;s he walked for half a mile without
knowing or caring in what direction he was going.</p>
<p>Phyl had done more than slap his face. She
had slapped his pride, his assurance of himself, and
his desire for her all at the same time.</p>
<p>Silas rarely bothered about girls, yet he knew
that he had the power to fascinate any woman once
he put his mind to the work. He had not tried his
powers of fascination on Phyl. It was the other
way about. Phyl absolutely unconsciously had used
her fascination upon him.</p>
<p>Something in her, recognised by him on their first
meeting in the stable yard, had put away the barrier
of sex. He had talked to her as if she had been a
boy. Sitting on the seat beside her whilst the
Colonel had been prosing over politics and tobacco,
the prompting came to Silas to pinch her finger just
for fun; when he had put his hands over her eyes
that night it was in obedience to the same prompting,
but at the moment of parting from her, a desire
quite new had overmastered him.</p>
<p>He had kissed a good many girls, but never in his
life had he kissed a girl as he kissed Phyl.</p>
<p>Something cynical in his feelings for the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
sex had always left him somewhat cold, but Phyl
was different from the others, she had in some way
struck straight at his real being.</p>
<p>When he left her that night at Grangersons he
was almost as disturbed as she.</p>
<p>He scarcely slept. He was out at dawn and on
his return after she had left he sat down and wrote
the letter which Phyl received next morning.</p>
<p>Silas was in love for the first time in his life, but
love with Silas was a thing apart from the love of
ordinary men.</p>
<p>There was no worship of the object; the something
that crystallises out in the form of love-letters,
verses, bouquets, and candy was not there. He
wanted Phyl.</p>
<p>He had no more idea of marriage than the great
god Pan. If she had consented he would have
taken her off on that yawl of his imagination round
the world or down to Florida, without thought of
the morrow or the <i>convenances</i>, or Society; but
please do not imagine this rather primitive gentleman
a chartered libertine. He would have married
her as soon as not, but he had neither the genius
nor the inclination for the courtship that leads by
slow degrees up to the question, &#8220;Will you marry
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>He wanted her at once.</p>
<p>As he walked along now with the devil awake
in his heart, he felt no anger towards Phyl; all his
rage was against Pinckney; he had never liked Pinckney,
he more than suspected that Phyl cared for him
and he wanted some one to hate badly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>He had walked himself into a reasonable state of
mind when he found himself outside the Queen City
Club. He went in and one of the first men he met
was Pinckney.</p>
<p>So well did he hold himself in hand that Pinckney
suspected nothing of his feelings. Silas was far too
good a sportsman to shout at the edge of the wood,
too much of a gentleman to desire a brawl in public.
He was going to knife Pinckney, he was also going
to capture Phyl, but the knifing of Pinckney was the
main objective and that required time and thought.
He did not desire the blood of the gentleman; he
wanted his pride and <i>amour propre</i>. He wanted
to hit him on the raw, but he did not know yet
where, exactly, the raw was nor how to hit it. Time
would tell him.</p>
<p>He was specially civil to his intended victim, and
he went off home that evening plotting all the way,
but arriving at nothing. He was trying to make
bricks without straw. Pinckney did not drink, nor
did he gamble, and he was far too good a business
man to be had in that way. However, all things
come to him who waits, and next morning&#8217;s post
brought him a ray of light in the midst of his darkness.</p>
<p>It brought him an invitation to the Rhetts&#8217; dance
on the following Wednesday; nearly a week to wait,
but, still, something to wait for.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you thinking about, Silas?&#8221; asked old
Seth Grangerson as they sat at breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of a new rabbit trap, suh,&#8221; responded
the son.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>The rabbit trap seemed to give him a good deal
of food for thought during the week that followed;
food that made him hilarious and gloomy by turns,
restless also.</p>
<p>Had he known it, Phyl away at Charleston, was
equally restless. She no longer thought of Silas.
She had dismissed him from her mind, she no longer
feared him as a possible source of danger to the man
she loved. Love had her entirely in his possession
to torture as he pleased. She knew only one danger,
the danger that Richard Pinckney did not care
in the least for her, and as day followed day that
danger grew more defined and concrete. Richard
had taken to avoiding her, she became aware of
that.</p>
<p>She fancied that she displeased him.</p>
<p>If she had only known!</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p>Silas Grangerson came to town on the
Wednesday, driving in and reaching the
Charleston Hotel about five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The Grangersons scarcely ever used the railway.
Silas, often as he had been in Charleston, had never
put foot in a street car; even a hired conveyance
was against the prejudices of these gentlemen.</p>
<p>This antagonism towards public means of locomotion
was not in the least the outcome of snobbishness
or pride; they had come from a race of
people accustomed to move in a small orbit in their
own particular way, an exclusive people, breeders
and lovers of horses, a people to whom locomotion
had always meant pride in the means and the
method; to take a seat in a stuffy railway car at so
much a mile, to grab a ticket and squeeze into a
tram car, to drive in a cab drawn by an indifferent
horse would have been hateful to these people; it
was scarcely less so to their descendants.</p>
<p>So Silas came to Charleston driving a pair of
absolutely matched chestnuts, a coloured manservant
in the Grangerson livery in attendance.</p>
<p>After dinner he strolled into the bar of the hotel,
met some friends, made some bets on the forthcoming
races and at eight o&#8217;clock retired upstairs to
dress.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>He was one of the first of the guests to arrive.</p>
<p>The Rhetts&#8217; house in Legare Street was about
the same size as Vernons and equally old, but it had
not the same charm, the garden was much larger
than that at Vernons, but it had not the same touch
of the past. Houses, like people, have personalities
and the house of the Rhetts had a telephone
without resenting the intruder, electric everythings,
even to an elevator, modern cookers, modern stoves,
everything in a modern way to save labour and make
life easy, and all so cunningly and craftily done that
the air of antiquity was supposed not to be disturbed.</p>
<p>Illusion! Nothing is gained without some sacrifice;
you cannot hold the past and the present in
the same hand, the concealed elevator spoke in all
the rooms once its presence was betrayed, the telephone
talked&mdash;everywhere was evident the use of
yesterday as a veneer of to-day.</p>
<p>However that may be, the old house was gay
enough to-night with flowers and lights, and Silas,
looking better perhaps than he had ever looked in
his life, found himself talking to Frances Rhett with
an animation that surprised himself.</p>
<p>Frances had never had a chance of leading Silas
behind her chariot; to fool with her would have
meant an expenditure of time and energy in journeys
to Charleston quite beyond his inclination.
This aloofness coupled with his good looks had set
him apart from others.</p>
<p>But to-night he was quite a different being; to-night,
in some mysterious way, he managed to convey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
the impression, pleasing enough, that he had
come to see her and her alone.</p>
<p>As they stood together for a moment, he led the
talk into Charleston channels, asking about this person
and that till the folk at Vernons came on the
<i>tapis</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it true what I hear, that Richard Pinckney
has become engaged to the girl who is staying
there?&#8221; asked Silas.</p>
<p>Frances smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Who told you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon my word I forget,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I judged
mostly by my own eyes&mdash;they seemed like an engaged
couple when I saw them last.&#8221;</p>
<p>New guests were arriving and she had to go forward
to help in receiving them. Silas moved towards
her, but in the next moment they had for a
snatch of conversation, she did not refer to the subject,
nor did he.</p>
<p>The Vernons people were late, so late that when
they arrived they were the last of the guests;
dancing was in progress and, on entering the ballroom,
Richard Pinckney was treated to the pleasing
sight of his <i>fiancée</i> whirling in the arms of Silas
Grangerson.</p>
<p>Phyl, looking lovely in the simple, rather old-fashioned
dress evolved for her by the combined
geniuses of Maria Pinckney and Madame Organdie,
produced that sensation which can only be
evoked by newness, her effect was instantaneous and
profound, it touched not only every one of these
strangers but also Maria Pinckney and Richard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
They had come with her, but it was only in the ballroom
that they recognised with whom they had
come.</p>
<p>So with a book, a picture, a play, the producer
and his friends only recognise its merits fully when
it is staged and condemned or praised by the public.</p>
<p>A <i>débutante</i> fails or succeeds at first glance, and
the instantaneous success of Phyl was a record in
successes.</p>
<p>And Frances Rhett had to watch it and dance.
The Inquisition had its torments; Society has improved
on them, for her victims cannot cry out and
the torments of Frances Rhett were acute. Not
that she was troubling much about Richard Pinckney
and what the poisonous Silas had said; she was not
in love with Richard Pinckney, but she was passionately
in love with herself. She was the belle
of Charleston; had been for the last year; and one
of her chief incentives to marriage was an intuitive
knowledge that prestige fades, that the position of
principal girl in any society is like the position of the
billiard ball the juggler balances on the end of a cue&mdash;precarious.
She wanted to get married and ring
down the curtain on an unspoiled success, and now
in a moment she saw herself dethroned.</p>
<p>In a moment. For no jeweller of Amsterdam
ever had an eye for the quality of diamonds surer
than the eye of Frances Rhett for the quality of
other women&#8217;s beauty. At the first glance to-night,
she saw what others saw, though more clearly than
they, that it was the touch of the past that gave Phyl
her <i>cachet</i>, a something indefinable from yesterday,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
the lack of which made the other girls, by contrast,
seem cheap.</p>
<p>Never could she have imagined that the &#8220;red-headed
girl at Vernons&#8221; could gain so much from
setting, a setting due to the instinct as well as the
taste of &#8220;that old Maria Pinckney.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had always laughed at Maria, as young people
sometimes will at the old.</p>
<p>When Richard came up to her a little later on, he
found himself coldly received; she had no dances for
him except a few at the bottom of the programme.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have been late,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it was not my fault. You
know what Aunt Maria is, she kept us ten minutes
after the carriage was round, and then Phyl wasn&#8217;t
ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She looks ready enough now,&#8221; said the other,
looking at Phyl and the cluster of young men around
her. &#8220;What delayed her? Was she dyeing her
head? It doesn&#8217;t look quite so loud as when I saw
her last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her head&#8217;s all right,&#8221; replied Pinckney, irritated
by the manner of the other, &#8220;inside and out,
and one can&#8217;t say the same for every one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frances looked at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what Silas Grangerson asked me
to-night?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He asked me were you engaged to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Phyl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Berknowles. I don&#8217;t know her well
enough to call her Phyl.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He asked you that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, said every one was talking of it, and the
last time he saw you together you looked like an engaged
couple the way you were carrying on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he has never seen us together,&#8221; cried the
outraged Pinckney; &#8220;that was a pure lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect he saw you when you didn&#8217;t see him;
anyhow, that&#8217;s the impression people have got, and
it&#8217;s not very pleasant for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Richard Pinckney choked back his anger. He
fell to thinking where Silas could have seen them
together.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether he saw us or not,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;but I am certain of one thing; he never saw us
&#8216;carrying on&#8217; as you call it; anyhow, I&#8217;ll have a personal
explanation from Silas to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Please</i> don&#8217;t imagine that I object to your flirting
with any one you like,&#8221; said Frances with exasperating
calm. &#8220;If you have a taste for that sort
of thing it is your own business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinckney flushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if you <i>want</i> to quarrel with me,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;if you do, say so at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;you know I never
quarrel with any one, it&#8217;s bad form for one thing
and it is waste of energy for another.&#8221;</p>
<p>A man came up to claim her for the next dance
and she went off with him, leaving Pinckney upset
and astonished at her manner and conduct.</p>
<p>It was their first quarrel, the first result of their
engagement. Frances had seemed all laziness and
honey up to this; like many another woman she began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
to show her real nature now that Pinckney was
secured.</p>
<p>But it was not an ordinary lovers&#8217; quarrel; her
anger had less to do with Richard Pinckney than
with Phyl. Her hatred of Phyl, big as a baobab
tree, covered with its shadow Vernons, Miss Pinckney,
and Richard.</p>
<p>He was part of the business of her dethronement.</p>
<p>Richard wandered off to where Maria Pinckney
was seated watching the dancers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you dancing?&#8221; asked she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m not keen
on it and there are loads of men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney had watched him talking to Frances
Rhett and she had drawn her own deductions,
but she said nothing. He sat down beside her.
He had been wanting to tell her of his engagement
for a long time past, but had put it off and put it
off, waiting for the psychological moment. Maria
Pinckney was a very difficult person to fit into a psychological
moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to tell you something,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;m
engaged to Frances Rhett.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Engaged to be married to her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney was dumb.</p>
<p>What she had always dreaded had come to pass,
then.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t congratulate me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, she turned on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulate you! If I saw you drowning in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
the harbour, would you expect me to stand at the
Battery waving my hand to you and congratulating
you? No, I don&#8217;t congratulate you. You had the
chance of being happy with the most beautiful girl
in the world, and the best, and you&#8217;ve thrown it
away to pick up with <i>that</i> woman. Phyl would
have married you, I know it, she would have made
you happy, I know it, for I know her and I know
you. Now it&#8217;s all spoiled.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose to his feet. It was the first time in his
life that he had seen Maria Pinckney really put out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to you again about it,&#8221; said he. Then
he moved away.</p>
<p>He had the pleasure of watching Frances dancing
the next waltz with Silas Grangerson, and Silas had
the pleasure of watching him as he stood talking to
one of the elderly ladies and looking on.</p>
<p>Silas&#8217;s rabbit trap was in reality a very simple
affair, it was a plan to pick a quarrel with Richard
through Frances, if possible; to make the imperturbable
Pinckney angry, knowing well how easily an
angry man can be induced to make a fool of himself.
To keep cool and let Richard do the shouting.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Silas, the sight of Phyl in all
her beauty had raised his temperature far above the
point of coolness. There were moments when he
was dancing, when he could have flung Frances aside,
torn Phyl from the arms of her partner and made
off with her through the open window.</p>
<p>This dance was a deadly business for him. It
was the one thing needed to cap and complete the
strange fascination this girl exercised upon his mind,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
his imagination, his body. It was only now that
he realised that nothing else at all mattered in the
world, it was only now that he determined to have
her or die.</p>
<p>Silas was of the type that kills under passion, the
type that, unable to have, destroys.</p>
<p>Preparing a trap for another, he himself had
walked into a trap constructed by the devil, stronger
than steel.</p>
<p>Yet he never once approached or tried to speak to
Phyl. He fed on her at a distance. Fleeting
glimpses of the curves of her figure, the Titian red
of her hair, the face that to-night might have turned
a saint from his vows, were snatched by him and
devoured. He would not have danced with her if
he could. To take her in his arms would have
meant covering her face with kisses. Nor did he
feel the least anger against the men with whom she
danced. All that was a sham and an unreality, they
were shadows. He and Phyl were the only real persons
in that room.</p>
<p>Later on in the evening, Richard Pinckney, tired
with the lights and the noise, took a stroll in the
garden.</p>
<p>The garden was lit here and there with fairy
lamps and there were coigns of shadow where couples
were sitting out chatting and enjoying the beauty
of the night.</p>
<p>The moon was nearing the full and her light cut
the tree shadows distinctly on the paths. Passing
a seat occupied by one of the sitting out couples,
Pinckney noticed the woman&#8217;s fan which her partner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
was playing with; it was his own gift to Frances
Rhett. The man was Silas Grangerson and the
woman was Frances. They were talking, but as he
passed them their voices ceased.</p>
<p>He felt their eyes upon him, then, when he had
got twenty paces or so away, he heard Frances
laugh.</p>
<p>He imagined that she was laughing at him. Already
angry with Silas, he halted and half turned,
intending to go back and have it out with him, then
he thought better of it and went his way. He would
deal with Silas later and in some place where he
could get him alone or in the presence of men only.
Pinckney had a horror of scenes, especially in the
presence of women.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later he had his opportunity. He
was crossing the hall from the supper room, when
he came face to face with Silas. They were alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said Richard Pinckney, halting in
front of the other, &#8220;I want a word with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; answered Silas, guessing at once what
was coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;You made some remarks about me to Miss Rhett
this evening,&#8221; went on the other. &#8220;You coupled
my name with the name of a lady in a most unjustifiable
manner and I want your explanation here
and now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was the lady?&#8221; asked Silas, seemingly quite
unmoved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Berknowles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way did I couple your name with her,
may I ask?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, you mayn&#8217;t.&#8221; Richard had turned pale before
the calm insolence of the other. &#8220;You know
quite well what you said and if you are a gentleman
you will apologise&mdash; If you aren&#8217;t you won&#8217;t and
I will deal with you in Charleston accordingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl was at that moment coming out of the supper
room with young Reggie Calhoun&mdash;the same
who, according to Richard that morning at breakfast
long ago, was an admirer of Maria Pinckney.</p>
<p>She saw the two men, in profile, facing one another,
and she saw Silas&#8217;s right hand, which he was
holding behind his back, opening and shutting convulsively.</p>
<p>She saw the blow given by Pinckney, she saw Silas
step back and the knife which he always carried, as
the wasp carries its sting, suddenly in his hand.</p>
<p>Then she was gripping his wrist.</p>
<p>Face to face with madness for a moment, holding
it, fighting eye to eye.</p>
<p>Had she faltered, had her gaze left his for the
hundredth part of a second, he would have cast her
aside and fallen upon his prey.</p>
<p>It was her soul that held him, her spirit&mdash;call it
what you will, the something that speaks alone
through the eye.</p>
<p>Calhoun and Pinckney stood, during that tremendous
moment, stricken, breathless, without making
the slightest movement. They saw she was holding
him by the power of her eye alone; so vividly did
this fact strike them that for a dazed moment it
seemed to them that the battle was not theirs, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
the contest was beyond the earthly plane, that this
was no struggle between human beings, but a battle
between sanity and madness.</p>
<p>Its duration might have been spanned by three
ticks of the great old clock that stood in the corner
of the hall telling the time.</p>
<p>Then came the ring of the knife falling on the
floor. It was like the breaking of a spell. Silas,
white and bewildered-looking as a man suddenly
awakened from sleep, stood looking now at his released
hand as though it did not belong to him, then
at Pinckney, and then at Phyl who had turned her
back upon him and was tottering as though about to
fall. Pinckney, stepping forward, was about to
speak, when at that moment the door of the supper
room opened and a band of young people came out
chatting and laughing.</p>
<p>Calhoun, who was a man of resource, kicked the
knife which slithered away under one of the seats.
Phyl, recovering herself, walked away towards the
stairs; Silas without a word, turned and vanished
from sight past the curtain of the corridor that led
to the cloakroom.</p>
<p>Calhoun and Pinckney were left alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; asked Calhoun.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am at his disposal,&#8221; replied the other. &#8220;I
struck him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Struck him, damnation! He drew a knife on
you; he ought to be hoofed out of the club; he&#8217;d have
had you only for that girl. I never saw anything so
splendid in my life.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Pinckney, &#8220;she saved my life. He
was clean mad, but thank God no one knows anything
about it and we avoided a scene. Say nothing
to any one unless he wants to push the matter further.
I am quite at his disposal.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p>When Silas reached the cloakroom he took a
glance at himself in the mirror, then putting
on his overcoat and taking his hat from the attendant
he came back into the hall. Pinckney and Calhoun
had just strolled away into the ballroom; there
was no one in the hall, and without a thought of
saying good-bye to his hostess, he left the house.</p>
<p>He felt no anger against Pinckney, nor did he
think as he walked down Legare Street that but
for the mercy of God and the intervention of Phyl
he might at that moment have been walking between
two constables, a murderer with the blood of innocence
on his hands.</p>
<p>Not that he was insensible to reason or the fitness
of things, he had always known and acknowledged
that when in a passion he was not accountable for
his acts; he admitted the fact with regret and also
with a certain pride. To-night he might have felt
the regret without any pride to leaven it but for the
fact that his mind was lost to every consideration
but one&mdash;Phyl.</p>
<p>All through his life Silas had followed with an
iron will the line that pleased him, never for a moment
had he counted the cost of his actions; just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
as he had swum the harbour with his clothes on so
had he plunged into any adventure that came to
hand; he knew Fear just as little as he knew Consequence.
Well, now he found himself for the first
time in his life face to face with Fate. All his adventures
up to this had been little things involving
at worst loss of life by accident. This was different;
it involved his whole future and the future of the
girl who had mastered his mind.</p>
<p>Leaving Legare Street he reached Meeting Street
and passed up it till he reached Vernons. The
moon, high in the sky now, showed the garden
through the trellis-work of the iron gate, and Silas
paused for a moment and looked in.</p>
<p>The garden, seen like this with the moonlight upon
the roses and the glossy leaves of the southern trees,
presented a picture charming, dream-like, almost unreal
in its beauty. He tried the gate. It was
locked. On ordinary nights it would be open till
the house closed, or in the event of Pinckney being
out, until he returned, but to-night, owing to the
absence of the family, it was locked.</p>
<p>Then, turning from the gate he crossed the road
and took up his position in a corner of shadow.
Five minutes passed, then twenty, but still he kept
watch. There were few passers-by at that hour and
little traffic; he had a long view of the moonlit street
and presently he saw the carriage he was waiting
for approaching.</p>
<p>It drew up at the front door of Vernons and he
watched whilst the occupants got out; he caught a
glimpse of Phyl as she entered the house following
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
Miss Pinckney and followed by Richard, then the
door shut and the carriage drove away.</p>
<p>Silas left his concealment and crossed the road.
He paced for a while up and down outside the door
of Vernons, then he came to the garden gate again
and looked in.</p>
<p>From here one could get a glimpse of the first and
second floor piazzas and the windows opening upon
them. He could not tell which was the window of
Phyl&#8217;s room, it was enough for him that the place
held her.</p>
<p>In the way in which he had crossed the road, in
his uneasy prowling up and down before the house,
and now in his attitude as he stood motionless with
head raised there was something ominous, animal-like,
almost wolfish.</p>
<p>As he stood a call suddenly came from the garden.
It was the call of an owl, a white owl that
rose on the sound and flitted softly as a moth across
the trees to the garden beyond.</p>
<p>Silas turned away from the gate and came back
down the street towards his hotel, arrived there he
went straight to his room and to bed.</p>
<p>But he did not go to sleep. His head was full
of plans, the craziest and maddest plans. Pinckney
he had quite dismissed from his mind, the consciousness
of having committed a vile action in drawing
a knife upon an unarmed man was with him, and the
knowledge that the consequences might include his
expulsion from Charleston society, but all that instead
of sobering him made him more reckless. He
would have Phyl despite the Devil himself. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
would seize her and carry her off, trap her like a
bird.</p>
<p>He determined on the morrow to return early to
Grangersons and think things out.</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p>Whilst he was lying in bed thinking things
out, the folk at Vernons were retiring to rest.</p>
<p>Maria Pinckney knew nothing of what had occurred
between Silas and Richard. Richard Pinckney,
Phyl and Reggie Calhoun were the only three
persons in Charleston, leaving Silas aside, who knew
of the business and in a hurried consultation just
before leaving the Rhetts they had agreed to say
nothing.</p>
<p>Calhoun was for publishing the affair.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man&#8217;s dangerous,&#8221; said he; &#8220;some day or
another he&#8217;ll do the same thing again to some one
and succeed and swing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s had his lesson,&#8221; said Pinckney; &#8220;he
went clean mad for the moment. Then there&#8217;s the
fact that I struck him. No, taking everything into
consideration, we&#8217;ll let it be. I don&#8217;t feel any animosity
against him, not half as much as if he&#8217;d
stabbed me behind the back with a libel&mdash; He did
tell a lie about me to-night but it was the stupid sort
of lie a child might have told. The man has his
good points as well as his bad and I don&#8217;t want to
push the thing against him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he will do it again,&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>She, like Richard, felt no anger against Silas; it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
was as though they recognised that Silas was the
man really attacked that night, attacked by the Devil.</p>
<p>They both recognised instinctively his good qualities.
Miss Pinckney, it will be remembered, once
said that it is the man with good in him that comes
to the worst end unless the good manages to fight
the bad and get it under in time. She had a terrible
instinct for the truth of things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Calhoun, &#8220;it&#8217;s not my affair; if you
choose to take pity on him, well and good; if it were
my business I&#8217;d give him a cold bath, that might stop
him from doing a thing like that again. I&#8217;ll say
nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Miss Pinckney was in ignorance of the
affair she was strangely silent during the drive home
and when Phyl went to her room to bid her good
night, she found her in tears, a very rare occurrence
with Miss Pinckney.</p>
<p>She was seated in an armchair crying and Phyl
knelt down beside her and took her hand.</p>
<p>Then it all came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had hoped and hoped and hoped for him, goodness
knows he has been my one thought, and now
he has thrown himself away. Richard is engaged
to Frances Rhett. He told me so to-night&mdash;well,
there, it&#8217;s all ended, there&#8217;s no hope anywhere, she&#8217;ll
never let him go, and she&#8217;ll have Vernons when I&#8217;m
gone. She picked him out from all the other men&mdash;why?&mdash; Why,
because he&#8217;s the best of the lot for
money and position. Care about him! She cares
no more for him than I do for old Darius. I&#8217;m sure
I don&#8217;t know why this trouble should have fallen on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
me. I suppose I have committed some sin or another
though I can&#8217;t tell what. I&#8217;ve tried to live
blameless and there&#8217;s others that haven&#8217;t, yet they
seem to prosper and get their wishes&mdash;and there&#8217;s
no use telling me to be resigned,&#8221; finished she with a
snap and as if addressing some viewless mentor. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t&mdash;and what&#8217;s more I won&#8217;t. Never will I resign
myself to wickedness, and stupidity is wickedness,
not even a decent, honest wickedness, but a
crazy, sap-headed sort of wickedness, same as influenza
isn&#8217;t a disease but just an ailment that kills you
all the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl, kneeling beside Miss Pinckney, had turned
deathly white. Only half an hour ago when the
little conference with Calhoun had been concluded,
Richard Pinckney had taken her hand. His words
were still ringing in her ears:</p>
<p>&#8220;You saved my life. I can&#8217;t say what I feel, at
least not now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had looked straight into her eyes, and now
half an hour later&mdash;This.</p>
<p>Engaged to Frances Rhett!</p>
<p>She rose up and stood beside Miss Pinckney for
a moment whilst that lady finished her complaints.
Then she made her escape and returned to her
room&mdash;</p>
<p>As she closed the door she caught a glimpse of
herself in the old-fashioned cheval glass that had
been brought up by Dinah and Seth to help her in
dressing for the dance and which had not been removed.
Every picture in every mirror is the work
of an artist&mdash;the man who makes a mirror is an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
artist; according to the perfection of his work is
the perfection of the picture. The old cheval glass
was as truthful in its way as Gainsborough, but Gainsborough
had never such a lovely subject as Phyl.</p>
<p>She started at her own reflection as though it had
been that of a stranger. Then she looked mournfully
at herself as a man might look at his splendid
gifts which he has thrown away. All that was no
use now.</p>
<p>She sat down on the side of her bed with her hands
clasped together just as a child clasps its hands in
grief.</p>
<p>Sitting like this with her eyes fixed before her she
was looking directly at Fate.</p>
<p>It was not only Richard Pinckney that she was
about to lose but Vernons and the Past&mdash; Just as
Juliet Mascarene had lost everything so was it to
happen to her. Or rather so had it happened, for
she felt that the game was lost&mdash;some vague, mysterious,
extraordinary game played by unknown powers
had begun on that evening in Ireland when standing
by the window of the library she had heard Pinckney&#8217;s
voice for the first time.</p>
<p>The sense of Fatality came to her from the case
of Juliet. Consciously and unconsciously she had
linked herself to Juliet. The extravagant idea that
she herself was Juliet returned and that Richard
Pinckney was Rupert had come to her more than once
since that dream or vision in which the guns had
sounded in her ears. The idea had frightened her
at first, then pleased her vaguely. Then she had
dismissed it, her <i>ego</i> refusing any one else a share in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
her love for Richard, any one&mdash;even herself masquerading
under the guise of Juliet.</p>
<p>The idea came back to her now leaving her utterly
cold, and yet stirring her mind anew with the
sense of Fate.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When she fell asleep that night she passed into
the dreamless condition which is the nearest thing
we know to oblivion, yet her sub-conscious mind must
have carried on its work, for when she awoke just
as dawn was showing at the window it was with the
sense of having passed through a long season of
trouble, of having fought with&mdash;without conquering&mdash;all
sorts of difficulties.</p>
<p>She rose and dressed herself, put on her hat and
came down into the garden.</p>
<p>Vernons was just wakening for the day, and in
the garden alive with birds, she could hear the early
morning sounds of the city, and from the servants&#8217;
quarters of the house, voices, the sound of a mat
being beaten and now and then the angry screech of
a parrot. General Grant slept in the kitchen and
his cage was put out in the yard every morning at
this hour. Later it would be brought round to the
piazza. He resented the kitchen yard as beneath
his dignity and he let people know it.</p>
<p>Phyl tried the garden gate, it was locked and Seth
appearing at that moment on the lower piazza, she
called to him to fetch the key. He let her out and
she stood for a moment undecided as to whether she
would walk towards the Battery or in the opposite direction.
Meeting Street never looked more charming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
than now in the very early morning sunlight;
under the haze-blue sky, almost deserted, it seemed
for a moment to have recaptured its youth. A negro
crab vendor was wheeling his barrow along, crying
his wares. His voice came lazily on the warm
scented air.</p>
<p>She turned in the direction of the station. The
voice of the crab seller had completed in some uncanny
way the charm of the deserted street and the
early sunlight. She was going to lose all this. Vernons
and the city she loved, Juliet, Miss Pinckney,
the past and the present, she was going to lose them
all, they were all in some miraculous way part of
the man she loved, her love of them was part of her
love for him. She could no longer stay in Charleston;
she must go&mdash;where? She could think of nowhere
to go but Ireland.</p>
<p>To stay here would be absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>As she walked without noticing whither she was
going her mind cleared, she began to form plans.</p>
<p>She would go that very day. Nothing would stop
her. The thing had to be done. Let it be done
at once. She would explain everything to Miss
Pinckney. She would escape without seeing Richard
again. What she was proposing to herself was
death, the ruin of everything she cared for, the destruction
of all the ties that bound her to the world,
the present and the past. It was the recognition that
these ties had been broken for her and all these things
taken away by the woman who had taken away
Richard.</p>
<p>Presently she found herself in the suburbs, in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
street where coloured children were playing in the
gutter, and where the houses were unsubstantial
looking as rabbit-hutches, but there was a glimpse
of country beyond and she did not turn back. She
did not want breakfast. If she returned to Vernons
by ten o&#8217;clock it would give her plenty of time to
pack her things, say good-bye to Miss Pinckney and
take her departure before Richard returned to
luncheon&mdash;if he did return.</p>
<p>It did not take her long to pass through the negro
quarter, and now, out in the open country, out
amidst those great flat lands in the broad day and
under the lonely blue sky her mood changed.</p>
<p>Phyl was no patient Grizel, the very last person
to be trapped in the bog of love&#8217;s despondency. Abstract
melancholy produced by colours, memories, or
sounds was an easy enough matter with her, but she
was not the person to mourn long over the loss of
a man snatched from her by another woman.</p>
<p>As she walked, now, breathing the free fresh air,
a feeling of anger and resentment began to fill her
mind. Anger at first against Frances Rhett but
spreading almost at once towards Richard Pinckney.
Soon it included herself, Maria Pinckney,
Charleston&mdash;the whole world. It was the anger
which brings with it perfect recklessness, akin to
that which had seized her the day in Ireland when
in her rage over Rafferty&#8217;s dismissal she had called
Pinckney a Beast. Only this anger was less acute,
more diffuse, more lasting.</p>
<p>The sounds of wheels and horses&#8217; hoofs on the
road behind her made her turn her head. A carriage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
was approaching, an English mail phaëton
drawn by two high-stepping chestnuts and driven
by a young man.</p>
<p>It was Silas Grangerson. Returning to Grangerson&#8217;s
to make plans for the capture of Phyl, here she
was on the road before him and going in the same
direction.</p>
<p>For a moment he could scarcely believe his eyes.
Then reining in and leaving the horses with the
groom he jumped down and ran towards her.</p>
<p>After the affair of last night one might fancy that
he would have shown something of it in his manner.</p>
<p>Not a bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect to come across <i>you</i> on the road,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you speak to me&mdash;are you angry
with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a question of being angry,&#8221; said Phyl,
stiffly.</p>
<p>She walked on and he walked beside her, silent
for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you mean about that affair last night,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I lost my temper&mdash;but he hit me&mdash;you
don&#8217;t understand what that means to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You tried to&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kill him, I did, and only for you I&#8217;d have done
it. You can&#8217;t understand it all. I can scarcely understand
it myself. He <i>hit</i> me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you knew what you were doing,&#8221;
said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I most surely did not. I was rousted out of
myself. I reckon he didn&#8217;t know what he was doing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
either when he struck. He ought to have known I
was not the person to hit. I&#8217;ll show you, just stand
before me for a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl faced him. He pretended to strike at her
and she started back.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are,&#8221; said he; &#8220;you know I wasn&#8217;t
going to touch you but you had to dodge. Your
mind had nothing to do with it, just your instinct.
That was how I was. When he landed his blow
I went for my knife by instinct. If you tread on a
snake he lets out at you just the same way. He
doesn&#8217;t think. He&#8217;s wound up by nature to hit
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are not a snake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know what&#8217;s in a man? I reckon
we&#8217;ve all been animals once, maybe I was a snake.
There are worse things than snakes. Snakes are all
right, they don&#8217;t meddle with you if you don&#8217;t meddle
with them. They&#8217;ve got a bad name they don&#8217;t
deserve. I like them. They&#8217;re a lot better citizens,
the way they look after their wives and families,
than some others and they know how to hit
back prompt&mdash;say, where are you going to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Phyl. &#8220;I just came for a
walk&mdash;I&#8217;m leaving Charleston.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke with a little catch in her voice. All
Silas&#8217;s misdoings were forgotten for the moment, the
fact that the man was dangerous as Death to himself
and others had been neutralised in her mind
by the fact, intuitively recognised, that there was
nothing small or mean in his character. Despite
his conduct in the cemetery, despite his lunatic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
outburst of the night before, in her heart of hearts she
liked him; besides that, he was part of Charleston,
part of the place she loved.</p>
<p>Ah, how she loved it! Had you dissected her
love for Richard Pinckney you would have found a
thousand living wrappings before you reached the
core. Vernons, the garden, the birds, the flowers,
the blue sky, the sunlight, Meeting Street, the story
of Juliet, Miss Pinckney, even old Prue. Memories,
sounds, scents, and colours all formed part of
the living thing that Frances Rhett had killed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leaving Charleston!&#8221; said Silas, speaking in a
dazed sort of way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I cannot stay here any longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going&mdash;say&mdash;it&#8217;s not because of what I did last
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;oh, no. It has nothing to do with you.&#8221;
She spoke almost disdainfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;But where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to Ireland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, in some curious manner, he knew.
But he was clever enough, for once in his life, to
restrain himself and say nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go this afternoon,&#8221; said she, as though
she were talking of a journey of a few miles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any friends to go to?&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl thought of Mr. Hennessy sitting in his
gloomy office in gloomy Dublin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Ireland?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you think of any other friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said poor Phyl, &#8220;I never could
understand you quite, but now that I am in trouble
you seem a friend&mdash;I&#8217;m miserable&mdash;but there&#8217;s no
use having friends here. It only makes it the worse
having to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember the day I asked you to run
off to Florida with me,&#8221; said Silas, &#8220;and leave this
damned place? It&#8217;s no good for any one here and
you&#8217;ve found it out&mdash;the place is all right, it&#8217;s the
people that are wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl made no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going back,&#8221; he finished.</p>
<p>She glanced at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to stay here&mdash;here with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going back to Ireland to-day,&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not, you are going to stay here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I am going back.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke as a person speaks who is half drowsy,
and Silas spoke like a person whose mind is half
absent. It was the strangest conversation to listen
to, knowing their relationship and the point at issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to stay here,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;If
I lost you now I&#8217;d never find you again. I&#8217;ve been
wanting you ever since I saw you that day first in
the yard&mdash; D&#8217;you remember how we sat on the
log together?&mdash;you can&#8217;t tramp all the way back to
Charleston&mdash; Come with me and you&#8217;ll be happy
always, all the time and all your life&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Phyl, &#8220;I mustn&#8217;t&mdash;I can&#8217;t.&#8221; Her
mind, half dazed by all she had gone through, by the
mesmerism of his voice, by the brilliant light of the
day, was capable of no real decision on any point.
The dark streets of Dublin lay before her, a vague
and nightmare vision. To return to Vernons would
be only her first step on the return to Ireland, and
yet if she did not return to Vernons, where could
she go?</p>
<p>Silas&#8217;s invitation to go with him neither raised her
anger nor moved her to consent. Phyl was an absolute
Innocent in the ways of the world. No careful
mother had sullied her mind with warnings and
suggestions, and her mind was by nature unspeculative
as to the material side of life.</p>
<p>Instinctively she knew a great deal. How much
knowledge lies in the sub-conscious mind is an open
question.</p>
<p>They walked on for a bit without speaking and
then Silas began again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t go back all that way. It&#8217;s absurd.
You talk of going off to-day, why, good heavens, it
takes time even to start on a journey like that. You
have to book your passage in a ship&mdash;and how are
you to go alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>His voice became soft. It was the first time
in his life, perhaps, that he had spoken with
tenderness, and the effect was perfectly magical.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not going,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are not; indeed,
I want you far too much to let you go; there&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
nothing else I want at all in the world. I don&#8217;t
count anything worth loving beside you.&#8221;</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>He turned.</p>
<p>The coloured groom was walking the horses, they
were only a few yards away. He went to the man
and gave him some money with the order to return
to Charleston and go back to Grangersons by train,
or at least to the station that was ten miles from
Grangerville.</p>
<p>Then as the man went off along the road he stood
holding the near horse by the bridle and talking
to Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t walk back all that way; put your foot
on the step and get in, leave all your trouble right
here. I&#8217;ll see that you never have any trouble again.
Put your foot on the step.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl looked away down the road.</p>
<p>She hesitated just as she had hesitated that morning
long ago when she had run away from school.
She had run away, not so much to get home as to
get away from homesickness.</p>
<p>Still she hesitated, urged by the recklessness that
prompted her to break everything at one blow, urged
by the dismal and hopeless prospect towards which
the road to Charleston led her mind, held back by
all sorts of hands that seemed reaching to her from
the past.</p>
<p>Confused, bewildered, tempted yet resisting, all
might have been well had not a vision suddenly risen
before her clear, definite, and destructive to her reason.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>The vision of Frances Rhett.</p>
<p>Everything bad and wild in Phyl surged up before
that vision. For a second it seemed to her
that she loathed the man she loved.</p>
<p>She put her foot on the step and got into the
phaëton. Silas, without a word, jumped up beside
her, and the horses started.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p>She had committed the irrevocable.</p>
<p>When the contract is signed, when the china
vase is broken, all the regret in the world will not
alter the fact.</p>
<p>It was not till they had gone ten miles on their
way that the regret came, sudden and painful as
the stab of a dagger.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney&#8217;s kindly old face suddenly rose up
before Phyl. She would have been waiting breakfast
for her. She saw the breakfast room, sunny
and pleasant, the tea urn on the table, the garden
through the open window&mdash;</p>
<p>Then came the thought&mdash;what matter.</p>
<p>All that was lost to her anyhow. It did not matter
in the least what she did.</p>
<p>She was running away with Silas Grangerson.</p>
<p>She had a vague sort of idea that they were running
away to be married, that she would have to
explain things to Colonel Grangerson when they
got to the house and that things would arrange
themselves somehow.</p>
<p>But now, she sat voiceless beside her companion,
answering only in monosyllables when he spoke; a
voice began to trouble her, a voice that repeated
the half statement, half question, over and over
again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are running away to be married to Silas
Grangerson?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was running away from her troubles, from
the prospect of returning to Ireland, from the idea
of banishment from Vernons. She was running
away out of anger against the woman who had taken
Richard. She was running away because of pique,
anger and the reckless craving to smash everything
and dash everything to pieces&mdash;but to marry Silas
Grangerson!</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried Phyl.</p>
<p>Silas glanced sideways at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to Charleston!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, stop, stop at once&mdash;I must go back, I should
never have come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silas was on the point of flashing out but he shut
his lips tight, then he reined in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; said he with his hand on her
arm, &#8220;you can&#8217;t walk back, we are nearly half way
to Grangersons. I can&#8217;t drive you because I don&#8217;t
want to return to Charleston. If you have altered
your mind you can go back when we reach Grangersons,
you can wire from there. The old man will
make it all right with Maria Pinckney.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl hesitated, then she began to cry.</p>
<p>It was the rarest thing in the world for her to cry
like this. Tears with her meant a storm, but now
she was crying quietly, hopelessly, like a lost child.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry,&#8221; said he, &#8220;everything will be all right
when we get to Grangersons&mdash;we&#8217;ll just go on.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>The horses started again and Phyl dried her eyes.
They covered another five miles without speaking,
and then Silas said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to stick to me, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You care for some one else better?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it Pinckney?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; said he. He cut the off horse with the
whip. The horses nearly bolted, he reined them in
and they settled down again to their pace.</p>
<p>The country was very desolate just here, cotton
fields and swampy grounds with here and there a
stretch of water reflecting the blue of the sky.</p>
<p>After a moment&#8217;s silence he began again.</p>
<p>There was something in Silas&#8217;s mentality that
seemed to have come up from the world of automata,
something tireless and persistent akin to the energy
that drives a beetle over all obstacles in its course,
on or round them.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but you can&#8217;t
always go on caring for Pinckney.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I?&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t. He&#8217;s going to get married and
then where will you be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl, staring over the horses&#8217; heads as though she
were staring at some black prospect, set her teeth.
Then she spoke and her voice was like the voice of
a person who speaks under mesmerism.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cared for him before he was born and I&#8217;ll
care for him after I&#8217;m dead and there&#8217;s no use in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
bothering a bit about it now. <i>You</i> couldn&#8217;t understand.
No one can understand, not even he.&#8221;</p>
<p>The road here bordered a stretch of waste land;
Silas gazed over it, his face was drawn and hard.</p>
<p>Then he suddenly blazed out.</p>
<p>Laying the whip over the horses and turning them
so sharply that the phaëton was all but upset he put
them over the waste land; another touch of the whip
and they bolted.</p>
<p>Beyond the waste land lay a rice field and between
field and waste land stood a fence; there was
doubtless a ditch on the other side of the fence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll kill us!&#8221; cried Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good&mdash;so,&#8221; replied Silas, &#8220;horses and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had half risen from her seat, she sat down
again holding tight to the side rail and staring ahead.
Death and destruction lay waiting behind that fence,
leaping every moment nearer. She did not care in
the least.</p>
<p>She could see that Silas, despite his words, was
making every effort to rein in, the impetus to drive
to hell and smash everything up had passed; she
watched his hands grow white all along the tendon
ridges with the strain. The whole thing was extraordinary
and curious but unfearful, a storm of
wind seemed blowing in her face. Then like a
switched out light all things vanished.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p>Twenty yards from the fence the off side
wheel had gone.</p>
<p>The phaëton, flinging its occupants out, tilted,
struck the earth at the trace coupling just as a man
might strike it with his shoulder, dragged for five
yards or so, breaking dash board and mud guard
and brought the off side horse down as though it
had been poleaxed.</p>
<p>Silas, with the luck that always fell to him in accidents,
was not even stunned. Phyl was lying like
a dead creature just where she had been flung
amongst some bent grass.</p>
<p>He rushed to her. She was not dead, her pulse
told that, nor did she seem injured in any way. He
left her, ran to the horses, undid the traces and got
the fallen horse on its feet, then he stripped them of
their harness and turned them loose.</p>
<p>Having done this he returned to the girl. Phyl
was just regaining consciousness; as he reached her
she half sat up leaning on her right arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the horses?&#8221; said she. They were
her first thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve let them loose&mdash;there they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned her head in the direction towards
which he pointed. The horses, free of their harness,
had already found a grass patch and were beginning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
to graze. The broken phaëton lay in the
sunshine and the cushions flung to right and left
showed as blue squares amidst the green of the
grass; a light wind from the west was stirring the
grass tops and a bird was singing somewhere its
thin piping note, the only sound from all that expanse
of radiant blue sky and green forsaken country.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you feel now?&#8221; asked Silas.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better get somewhere,&#8221; he went on; &#8220;there
are some cabins beyond that rice field, I can see
their tops. There&#8217;s sure to be some one there and
we can send for help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl struggled to her feet, refusing assistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go there,&#8221; said she. She turned to look
at the horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be all right,&#8221; said Silas; &#8220;there&#8217;s lots of
grass and there&#8217;s a pond over there&mdash;they&#8217;d live
here a month without harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the way to the fence, helped her over, and
then, without a word they began to plod across the
rice field.</p>
<p>When they reached the cabins they found them
deserted, almost in ruins. They faced a great tract
of tree-grown ground. In the old plantation days
this place would have been populous, for to the
right there were ruins of other cabins stretching
along and bordering an old grass road that bent
westward to lose itself amongst the trees, but now
there was nothing but desolation and the wind that
stirred the mossy beards of the live oaks and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
rank green foliage of weeds and sunflowers. An
old disused well faced the cabins.</p>
<p>Phyl gave a little shudder as she looked around
her. Her mind, still slightly confused by the accident
and beaten upon by troubles, could find nothing
with which to reply to the facts of the situation&mdash;alone
here with Silas Grangerson, lost, both of them,
what explanation could she make, even to herself, of
the position?</p>
<p>In the nearest cabin to the right some rough dry
grass had been stored as if for the bedding of an
animal. It was too coarse for fodder. Silas made
her sit down on it to rest. Then he stood before
her in the doorway.</p>
<p>For the first time in his life he seemed disturbed
in mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to go and get help,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and find
out where we are. It&#8217;s my fault. I&#8217;m sorry, but
there&#8217;s no use in going over that. You aren&#8217;t fit to
walk. I&#8217;ll go and leave you here. You won&#8217;t be
afraid to stay by yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be a bit, there&#8217;s no danger here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am thirsty,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went to the well head. The windlass and
chain were there rusty but practicable and a bucket
lay amongst the grass. It was in good repair and
had evidently been used recently. He lowered it
and brought up some water. The water was clear
diamond bright, and cold as ice. Having satisfied
himself that it was drinkable he brought the bucket
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
to Phyl and tilted it slightly whilst she drank. Then
he put it by the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I shan&#8217;t be long.
Sure you won&#8217;t be afraid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not angry with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bent down, took her hand and kissed it. She
did not draw it away or show any sign of resentment;
it was cold like the hand of a dead person.</p>
<p>He glanced back as he turned to go. She saw him
stand at the doorway for a moment looking down
along the grass road, his figure cut against the blaze
of light outside, then the doorway was empty.</p>
<p>She was never to see him again.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Outside in the sunlight Silas hesitated for a moment
as though he was about to turn back, then he
went on, striking along the grass road and between
the trees.</p>
<p>Although he had never been over the ground before,
he guessed it to be a part of the old Beauregard
plantation and the distance from Grangerville
to be not more than eight miles as the crow flies.
By the road, reckoning from where the accident had
occurred, it would be fifteen. But the lie of the
place or the distance from Grangersons mattered
little to Silas. His mind was going through a process
difficult to describe.</p>
<p>Silas had never cared for anything, not even for
himself. Danger or safety did not enter into his
calculations. Religion was for him the name of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
thing he did not understand. He had no finer feelings
except in relationship to things strong, swift
and brilliant, he had no tenderness for the weakness
of others, even the weakness of women.</p>
<p>He had seized on Phyl as a Burgomaster gull
might seize on a puffin chick, he had picked her up
on the road to carry her off regardless of everything
but his own desire for her&mdash;a desire so strong that
he would have dashed her and himself to pieces
rather than that another should possess her.</p>
<p>Well, as he watched her seated on the straw in
that ruined cabin, subdued, without energy, and entirely
at his mercy, a will that was not his will rose
in opposition to him. Some part of himself that
had remained in utter darkness till now woke to life.
It was perhaps the something that despite all his
strange qualities made him likeable, the something
that instinct guessed to be there.</p>
<p>It stood between him and Phyl. He was conscious
of no struggle with it because it took the form
of helplessness.</p>
<p>Nothing but force could make her give him what
he wanted. The thing was impossible, beyond him.
He felt that he could do everything, fight everything,
subdue everything&mdash;but the subdued.</p>
<p>There was something else. Weakness had always
repelled him, whether it was the weakness of
the knees of a horse or the weakness of the will of
a man. Phyl&#8217;s weakness did not repel him but it
took the edge from his passion. It was almost a
form of ugliness.</p>
<p>He had determined on finding help to send some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
one back for Phyl; any of the coloured folk hereabouts
would be able to pilot her to Grangersons.
He was not troubling about the broken phaëton or
the horses; the horses had plenty of food and water;
so far from suffering they would have the time of
their lives. They might be stolen&mdash;he did not care,
and nothing was more indicative of his mental upset
than this indifference toward the things he treasured
most.</p>
<p>All to the left of the grass road, the trees were
thin, showing tracts of marsh land and pools, and
the melancholy green of swamp weeds and vegetation.</p>
<p>The vegetable world has its reptiles and amphibians
no less than the animal; its savages, its half
civilised populations, and its civilised. The two
worlds are conterminous, and just as cultivated
flowers and civilised people are mutually in touch,
here you would find poisonous plants giving shelter
to poisonous life, and the amphibious giving home
to the amphibious.</p>
<p>The woods on the right were healthier, more
dense, more cheerful, on higher ground; one might
have likened the grass road to the life of a man
pursuing its way between his two mysteriously different
characters.</p>
<p>Silas had determined to make straight for home
after having sent assistance for Phyl, what he was
going to do after arriving home was not evident to
his mind; he had a vague idea of clearing out somewhere
so that he might forget the business. He
had done with Phyl, so he told himself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></p>
<p>But Phyl had not done with him. He had been
scarcely ten minutes on his road when her image
came into his mind. He saw her, not as he had
seen her last seated on the straw in the miserable
cabin, but as he had seen her at the ball.</p>
<p>The curves of her limbs, the colour of her hair,
her face, all were drawn for him by imagination, a
picture more beautiful even than the reality.</p>
<p>Well, he had done with her, and there was no
use in thinking of her&mdash;she cared for that cursed
Pinckney and she was as good as dead to him, Silas.</p>
<p>An ordinary man would have seen hope at the
end of waiting, but Silas was not an ordinary man,
a long and dubious courtship was beyond his imagination
and his powers. Courtship, anyhow, as
courtship is recognised by the world was not for him.
He wanted Phyl, he did not want to write letters
to her.</p>
<p>There is something to be said for this manner
of love-making, it is sincere at all events.</p>
<p>He tried to think of something else and he only
succeeded in thinking of Phyl in another dress. He
saw her as he saw her that first day in the stable
yard at Grangersons. Then he saw her as she was
dressed that day in Charleston.</p>
<p>Then he remembered the scene in the churchyard.
He could still feel the smack she had given
him on the face. The smack had not angered him
with her but the remembrance of it angered him
now. She would not have done that to Pinckney.</p>
<p>Turning a corner of the road he came upon a
clear space and on the borders of the clearing to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
the right some cottages. There were some half-naked
pikaninnies playing in the grass before them;
and a coloured woman, washing at a tub set on trestles,
catching sight of him, stood, shading her eyes
and looking in his direction.</p>
<p>Silas paused for a moment as if undecided, then
he came on. He asked the woman his whereabouts
and then whether she could sell him some food.
She had nothing but some corn bread and cold bacon
to offer him and he bought it, paying her a dollar
and not listening to her when she told him she could
not make change.</p>
<p>He was like a man doing things in his sleep; his
mind seemed a thousand miles away. The woman
packed the bread and bacon in a mat basket with
a plate and knife and watched him turn back in his
tracks and vanish round the bend of the road, glad
to see the last of him. She reckoned him crazy.</p>
<p>He was going back to Phyl.</p>
<p>His resolution never to see her again had vanished.
She was his and he was going to keep her,
no matter what happened.</p>
<p>He would never part with her alive, if she killed
him, if he killed her, what matter. Nothing would
stand in his path.</p>
<p>He reached the turning and there in the sunlight
lay the half ruined cabins and the well.</p>
<p>Walking softly he came to the door of the cabin
where he had left Phyl. She was there lying on the
straw fast asleep. It was the sleep that comes after
exhaustion or profound excitement; she scarcely
seemed to breathe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>Putting his bundle down by the door he came in
softly and knelt down beside her. His face was so
close to hers that he could feel her breath upon his
mouth.</p>
<p>It only wanted that to complete his madness. He
was about to cast himself beside her when a pain,
vicious and sharp as the stab of a red hot needle
struck him just above his right instep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p>When Richard Pinckney came down to breakfast
that morning, he found Miss Pinckney
seated at the table reading letters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phyl went out early and has not come back yet,&#8221;
said she putting the letters aside and pouring out
the tea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone out,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Where can she have gone
to?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney did not seem to hear the question.
She was not thinking of Phyl or her whereabouts.
Richard&#8217;s engagement to Frances Rhett was still
dominating her mind, casting a shadow upon everything.
It was like a death in the family.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope she&#8217;s not bothered about what happened
last night,&#8221; went on Richard. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell you at
the time, but I had&mdash;some words with Silas Grangerson,
and&mdash;Phyl was there. Silas is a fool, but
it&#8217;s just as well the thing happened for it has brought
matters to a head. I want to tell you something&mdash;I&#8217;m
not engaged to Frances Rhett.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not engaged?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was, but it&#8217;s broken off. I had a moment&#8217;s
talk with her before we left last night. I was in a
temper about a lot of things, and the business with
Silas put the cap on it. Anyhow, we had words,
and the thing is broken off.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney. The joyful
shock of the news seemed to have reduced her mind
to chaos for a moment. One could not have told
from her words or manner whether the surprise
was pleasant or painful to her.</p>
<p>She drew her chair back from the table a little,
and sought for and found her handkerchief. She
dried her eyes with it as she found her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure. I&#8217;ve
prayed all night that this might be, and now that
the Lord has heard my prayer and answered it, I
feel cast right down with the wonder of it. Had
I the right to interfere? I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure.
It seems terrible to separate two people but I had
no thought only for you. I&#8217;ve spoken against the
girl, and wished against her, and felt bad in my
heart against her, and now it&#8217;s all over I&#8217;m just cast
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did not care for me,&#8221; said Pinckney.
&#8220;Why she was laughing at me last night with him.
They were sitting outside together, and when I
passed them I heard them laughing at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney put her handkerchief away, drew
in her chair, and poured herself out some more tea
energetically and with a heightened colour.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to speak bad about any one,&#8221; said
she, &#8220;but there are girls and girls. I know them,
and time and again I&#8217;ve seen girls hanging themselves
out with labels on them. &#8216;I&#8217;m the finest
apple on the tree,&#8217; yet no one has picked them for
all their labels, because every one has guessed that
they aren&#8217;t&mdash;That crab apple labelling itself a pippin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
and daring to laugh at you! And that long
loony Silas Grangerson, a man without a penny to
bless himself with, a creature whose character is
just kinks. Well, I&#8217;m sure&mdash;pass me the butter&mdash;laughing
at you. And what were they laughing at
pray? Aren&#8217;t you straight and the best looking
man in Charleston? Couldn&#8217;t you buy the Rhetts
twice over if you wanted to buy such rubbish?
Aren&#8217;t you the top man in Charleston in name and
position and character? Why, they&#8217;ll be laughing
at the jokes in the N&#8217;York papers next&mdash;They&#8217;ll
be appreciating their own good sense and cleverness
and personal beauty next thing&mdash;They&#8217;ll be worshipping
Bryan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll ever get as bad as that,&#8221;
said he laughing, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t think I care whether
people grin at me or not; it&#8217;s only just this, she and
I were never meant for each other, and I found it
out, and found it out in time. You see the engagement
was never made public, so the breaking of it
won&#8217;t do her any harm. She would not let me tell
people about it, she said it would be just as well to
keep it secret for a while, and then if either of us
felt disposed we could break it off and no harm
done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning that she could break it off if she
wanted to but you couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps. When I went back last night and
told her I wanted to be free, she flew out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Said you must stick to your word?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly that. Then I told her she herself had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
said that it was open to either of us to break the
business off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did she say to that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. She had nothing to say. She asked
why I wanted to break it off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you told her it was because of her conduct,
I hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I told her it was because I had come to
care for some one else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney said nothing for a moment.
Then she looked at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Richard, do you care for Phyl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>The one supreme wish of her life had been
granted to her. Her gaze wandered to the glimpse
of garden visible through the open window and
rested there. She was old, she had seen friend and
relative fade and vanish, the Mascarenes, the
Pinckneys, children, old people, all had become part
of that mystery, the past. Richard alone remained
to her, and Phyl. On the morning of Phyl&#8217;s arrival
Miss Pinckney had felt just as though some
door had opened to let this visitor in from the world
of long ago. It was not only her likeness to Juliet
Mascarene, but all the associations that likeness
brought with it. Vernons became alive again, as
in the good old days. Charleston itself caught
some tinge of its youth. And there was more than
that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Richard,&#8221; said she, coming back from her fit of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
abstraction, &#8220;I will tell you something I&#8217;d never
have spoken of if you didn&#8217;t care for her. It may
be an old woman&#8217;s fancy, but Phyl is more to us,
seems to me, than we think, she&#8217;s Juliet come back&mdash;Oh,
it&#8217;s more than the likeness. I&#8217;m sure I can&#8217;t
explain what I mean, it&#8217;s just she herself that&#8217;s the
same. There&#8217;s a lot more to a person than a face
and a figure. I know it sounds absurd, so would
most things if we had never heard them before.
What&#8217;s more absurd than to be born, and look at that
butterfly, what&#8217;s more absurd than to tell me that
yesterday it was a worm? Well, it doesn&#8217;t much
matter whether she was Juliet or not, now she&#8217;s
going to be yours, and to save you from that pasty&mdash;no
matter she&#8217;s over and done with, but I reckon
she&#8217;s laughing on the wrong side of her face this
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney rose from the table. The absence
of Phyl did not disturb her. Phyl sometimes
stayed out and forgot meals, though this was the
first time she had been late for breakfast. Richard,
who had business to transact that morning in the
town looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to Philips&#8217;, the lawyers,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and then I&#8217;ll look in at the club. I&#8217;ll be back to
luncheon.&#8221;</p>
<p>An hour later to Miss Pinckney engaged in dusting
the drawing-room appeared Rachel the cook.</p>
<p>Rachel was the most privileged of the servants,
a trustworthy woman with a character and will of
her own, and absolutely devoted to the interests of
the house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mistress Pinckney,&#8221; said the coloured woman
closing the door. &#8220;Ole Colonel Grangerson&#8217;s
coachman&#8217;s in de kitchen, an&#8217; he says Miss Phyl&#8217;s
been an&#8217; run off with young Silas Grangerson dis
very mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney without dropping the duster stood
silent for a moment before Rachel. Then she
broke out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Phyl run off with young Silas Grangerson!
What on earth are you talking about, what rubbish
is this, who&#8217;s dared to come here talking such nonsense?
Go on&mdash;what more have you to say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rachel had a lot to say.</p>
<p>Phyl had met Silas on the road beyond the town.
They had talked together, then Silas had sent the
groom back to Charleston to return to Grangerville
by train, and had driven off with Phyl. The
groom, a relation of Dinah&#8217;s, having some three
hours to wait for a train, had dropped into Vernons
to pass the time and tell the good news. He was
in the kitchen now.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney could not but believe. She threw
the duster on a chair, left the room and went to
the kitchen.</p>
<p>Prue was still in her corner by the fireplace, and
Colonel Grangerson&#8217;s coloured man was seated at
the table finishing a meal and talking to Dinah who
scuttled away as he rose up before the apparition of
Miss Pinckney.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this nonsense you have been talking,&#8221;
said she, &#8220;coming here saying Miss Phyl has
run away with Mr. Silas? She started out this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
morning to meet him and drive to Grangersons; I&#8217;m
going there myself at eleven&mdash;and you come here
talking of people running away. Do you know you
could be put in prison for saying things like that?
You <i>dare</i> to say it again to any one and I&#8217;ll have
you taken off before you&#8217;re an hour older, you black
imp of mischief.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a rolling pin on the table, and half
unconsciously her hand closed on it. Colonel
Grangerson&#8217;s man, grey and clutching at his hat, did
not wait for the sequel, he bolted.</p>
<p>Then the unfortunate woman, nearly fainting, but
supported by her grand common sense and her invincible
nature, left the kitchen and, followed by
Rachel, went to the library. Here she sat down for
a moment to collect herself whilst Rachel stood
watching her and waiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so and it&#8217;s not so,&#8221; said she at last, talking
half to herself half to the woman. &#8220;It&#8217;s some trick
of Silas Grangerson&#8217;s. But the main thing is no
one must know. We have got to get her back. No
one must know&mdash;Rachel, go and find Seth and send
him off at once to the garage place and tell them to
let me have an automobile at once, at once, mind
you. Tell them I want the quickest one they&#8217;ve got
for a long journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rachel went off and Miss Pinckney left to herself
went down on her knees by the big settee adjoining
the writing table and began to wrestle with the situation
in prayer. Miss Pinckney was not overgiven
to prayer. She held that worriting the Almighty
eternally about all sorts of nonsense, as some people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
do who pray for &#8220;direction&#8221; and weather, etc., was
bad form to say the least of it. She even went further
than that, and held that praising him inordinately
was out of place and out of taste. Saying
that, if Seth or Dinah came singing praises at her
bedroom door in the morning instead of getting on
with their work, she would know exactly what it
meant&mdash;Laziness or concealed broken china, or
both.</p>
<p>But in moments of supreme stress and difficulty,
Miss Pinckney was a believer in prayer. Her
prayer now was speechless, one might compare it
to a mental wrestle with the abominable situation
before God.</p>
<p>When she rose from her knees everything was
clear to her. Two things were evident. Phyl
must be got back at any cost, and scandal must be
choked, even if it had to be choked with solid lies.</p>
<p>To save Phyl&#8217;s reputation, Miss Pinckney would
have perjured herself twice over.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney had many faults and limitations,
but she had the grand common sense of a clean
heart and a clear mind. She could tell a lie with a
good conscience in a good cause, but to hide even a
small fault of her own, the threat of death on the
scaffold would not have made her tell a lie.</p>
<p>She went to the writing table now and taking a
sheet of paper, wrote:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><i>Dear Richard,</i></p>
<p>Seth Grangerson is bad again, and I am going
over there now with Phyl. We mayn&#8217;t be back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
to-night. I am taking the automobile. We will be
back to-morrow most likely.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:2em;'>Your affectionate Aunt,</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Maria Pinckney.</span></p>
</div>

</div>
<p>She read the note over. If all went well then
everything would be well. If the worst occurred
then she could explain everything to Richard.</p>
<p>It was a desperate gamble; well she knew how the
dice were loaded against her, but the game had to
be played out to the very last moment.</p>
<p>Already she had stopped the mouth of slander by
her prompt action with Colonel Grangerson&#8217;s
coloured man, but she well knew how coloured servants
talk; Grangerson&#8217;s man was safe enough, he
was frightened and he would have to get back to
Grangerville. Rachel was absolutely safe, Dinah
alone was doubtful.</p>
<p>She called Rachel in, gave her the note for Richard
and told her to keep a close eye on Dinah.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let her get talking to any one,&#8221; said Miss
Pinckney, &#8220;and when Mr. Richard comes in give him
that note yourself. If he asks about Miss Phyl, say
she came back and went with me. You understand,
Rachel, Miss Phyl has done a foolish thing, but
there&#8217;s no harm in it, only what fools will make of
it if they get chattering. No one must know, not
even Mr. Richard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see to that, Miss Pinckney, an&#8217; if I catch
Dinah openin&#8217; her mouth to say more&#8217;n &#8216;potatoes&#8217;
I&#8217;ll dress her down so&#8217;s she won&#8217;t know which end
of her&#8217;s which.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>Miss Pinckney went upstairs, dressed hurriedly,
packed a few things in a bag and the automobile being
now at the door, started.</p>
<p>It was after one o&#8217;clock when she reached Grangersons.</p>
<p>Just as on the day when she had arrived with
Phyl, Colonel Grangerson, hearing the noise of the
car, came out to inspect.</p>
<p>He came down the steps, hat in hand, saw the
occupant, started back, and then advanced to open
the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, God bless my soul, it&#8217;s you,&#8221; cried the
Colonel. &#8220;What has happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney without a word got out and went
up the steps with him.</p>
<p>In the hall she turned to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Silas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Silas,&#8221; replied the Colonel. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen
him since he went to Charleston to attend some
dance or another. What on earth is the matter
with you, Maria?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in here,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney. She went
into the drawing room and they shut the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Silas has run away with Phyl,&#8221; said she, &#8220;that&#8217;s
what&#8217;s the matter with me. Your son has taken
that girl off, Seth Grangerson, and may God have
mercy upon him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The red-headed girl?&#8221; said the Colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phyl,&#8221; replied she, &#8220;you know quite well whom
I mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colonel Grangerson made a few steps up and
down the room to calm himself. Maria Pinckney
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
was speaking to him in a tone which, had it been
used by any one else, would have caused an explosion.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when did it happen,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;and where
have they gone? Explain yourself, Maria. Good
God! Why the fellow never spoke to her scarcely&mdash;are
you sure of what you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney told her tale.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came here to try and get her back,&#8221; said she,
&#8220;thinking he and she might possibly have come here
or that you might know their whereabouts&mdash;they
have not come, but there is just the chance that they
may come here yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if they have run off with each other,&#8221; said
the Colonel, &#8220;how are we to stop them&mdash;they&#8217;ll be
married by this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney who had taken off her gloves sat
down and began to fold them, neatly rolling one inside
the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Married,</i>&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>The Colonel standing by the window with his
hands in his pockets turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not?&#8221; said he. &#8220;The girl&#8217;s a lady, and
you told me she was not badly off. Silas might have
done worse it seems to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Done worse! He couldn&#8217;t have done worse.
I&#8217;d sooner see her dead in her coffin than married to
Silas&mdash;There, you have it plain and straight. He&#8217;ll
make her life a misery. Let me speak, Seth Grangerson,
you are just going to hear the truth for once.
You have ruined that boy the way you&#8217;ve brought
him up, he was crazy wild to start with and you&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
never checked him. Oh, I know, he has always
been respectful to you and flattered your pride and
vanity, he calls you sir when he speaks to you, and
you are the only person in the world to whom he
shews respect. I don&#8217;t say he acts like that from
any double dealing motive, it&#8217;s just the old southern
tradition he&#8217;s inherited; he does respect you, and I
daresay he&#8217;s fond of you, but he respects nothing
else, especially women. I know him. And I know
her, and he&#8217;ll make her life a misery. If he&#8217;d left
her alone she&#8217;d have been happy. Richard loves
her, and would have made her a good husband.
My mind was set on it, and now it&#8217;s all over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney began to weep, and the Colonel
who had been swelling himself up found his anger
collapsing. She was only a woman. Women
have queer fancies&mdash;This especial woman too was
part of the past and privileged.</p>
<p>He came to her and stood beside her and rested
his hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Maria,&#8221; said the Colonel, &#8220;youth is
youth&mdash;There is not any use in laying down the law
for young people or making plans for their marriages.
Leave it in the hands of Providence. The
most carefully arranged marriages often turn out
the worst, and a scratch match has often as not
turned out happily. Anyhow, you will stay here
till news comes of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will stay,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock that night, just as Miss
Pinckney was on the point of retiring to bed
the news came in the form of Phyl herself.</p>
<p>She arrived in a buggy driven by the farmer who
owned the land through which the grass road ran.</p>
<p>She gave a little glad cry when she saw Miss
Pinckney and ran into her arms.</p>
<p>Upstairs and alone with the lady, she told her
story. Told her how she had met Silas on the road
that morning, how, tired of life and scarce knowing
what she did, she had got into the phaëton, how he
had upset it and smashed it, how she had sheltered
in the cabin whilst he went in search of help.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I went to sleep,&#8221; said Phyl, &#8220;and when I
woke up it was afternoon. He was not there, but
he must have come back when I was asleep and left
some food for me, for there was a bundle outside
the door with some bread and bacon in it. Then I
started off to walk and found a village with some
coloured people. I told them I was lost and wanted
to get to Grangersons. They were kind to me, but
I had to wait a long time before they could find that
gentleman, the farmer, and he could get a cart to
drive me here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God it is all over and you are back,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
Miss Pinckney. &#8220;But oh, Phyl! what made you do
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Phyl.</p>
<p>But Miss Pinckney did.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said she. &#8220;You know what I told you
about Richard and Frances Rhett&mdash;that&#8217;s all done
with. He has broken off the engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyl flushed, then she hid her burning face on
Miss Pinckney&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney held her for awhile. Then she
began to talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will get right back to-morrow early; no one
knows anything and I&#8217;ll take care they never do.
Well, it&#8217;s strange&mdash;I can understand everything but
I can&#8217;t understand that crazy creature. What&#8217;s become
of him? That&#8217;s what I want to know.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>This is what had become of him.</p>
<p>Kneeling beside Phyl the sudden sharp pain just
above his instep made him turn. In turning he
caught a glimpse of his assailant. It had been
creeping towards the door when he entered and had
taken refuge beneath the straw. He had almost
knelt on it. Escaping, a movement of his foot had
raised its anger and it had struck, it was now whisking
back into the darkness of the cabin beyond the
straw heap.</p>
<p>He recognised it as the deadliest snake in the
South.</p>
<p>For a moment he recognised nothing else but the
fact that he had been bitten.</p>
<p>His passion and desire had vanished utterly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
Phyl might have been a thousand miles away from
him for all that he thought of her.</p>
<p>He rose up and came out into the sunlight, went
to the well head, sat down on the frame and removed
his shoe and sock. The mark of the bite was there
between the adductor tendons. A red hot iron and
a bottle of whisky might have saved him. He had
not even a penknife to cut the wound out&mdash;He
thought of Phyl, she could do nothing. He thought
of the bar of the Charleston Hotel, and the verse of
the song about the old hen with a wooden leg and
the statement that it was just about time for another
little drink, ran through his head.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the idea came to him that there
might possibly be help at the village where he had
obtained the food from the coloured woman. It
was a long way off, but still it was a chance.</p>
<p>He put the sock in his pocket, put on the shoe and
started. He ran for the first couple of hundred
yards, then he slackened his pace, then he stopped
holding one hand to his side.</p>
<p>The poison already had hold of him.</p>
<p>The game was up and he knew it. It was useless
to go on, he would not live to reach the village or
reaching it would die there.</p>
<p>And every one would pity him with that shuddering
pity people extend to those who meet with a
horrible form of death.</p>
<p>Death from snake bite was a low down business,
it was no end for a Grangerson; but there in the
swamp to the left a man might lie forever without
being found out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>He turned from the road to the left and walked
away among the trees.</p>
<p>The ground here sank beneath the foot, a vague
haze hung above the marsh and the ponds. Here
nothing happened but the change of season,
night and day, the chorus of frogs and the crying
of the white owl amidst the trees.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p>Miss Pinckney and Phyl left Grangersons
next morning at seven o&#8217;clock to return to
Charleston.</p>
<p>During the night the Colonel had sent after the
horses and they had been captured and brought
back. The broken phaëton was left for the present.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make Silas go and fetch it himself when he
comes back,&#8221; said the Colonel. &#8220;I reckon the exercise
will do him good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney, &#8220;and then send him
on to me. I reckon what I&#8217;ll give him will help him
to forget the exercise.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the way back she said little. She was reckoning
with the fact that she had deceived Richard.
Now that everything had turned out so innocently
and so well she decided to tell him the bare facts of
the matter. There was nothing to hide except the
fact of Phyl&#8217;s stupidity in going with Silas.</p>
<p>Richard Pinckney was not in when they arrived
but he returned shortly before luncheon time and
Miss Pinckney, who was waiting for him, carried
him off into the library.</p>
<p>She shut the door and faced him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Richard,&#8221; said Miss Pinckney, &#8220;Seth Grangerson
is as well as you are. I didn&#8217;t go to see him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
because he was ill, I went because of Phyl. She did
a stupid thing and I went to set matters right.&#8221;</p>
<p>She explained the whole affair. How Phyl had
met Silas, how he had persuaded her to get into the
phaëton with him, the accident and all the rest.
The story as told by Miss Pinckney was quite simple
and without any dark patches, and no man, one
might fancy, could find cause for offence in it.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney, however, was quite unconscious
of the fact that Silas Grangerson had attempted to
take Richard Pinckney&#8217;s life on the night of the
Rhetts&#8217; dance.</p>
<p>To Richard the thought that Phyl should have
met Silas only a few hours after that event, talked
to him, made friends with him, and got into his carriage
was a monstrous thought. He could not understand
the business in the least, he could only
recognise the fact.</p>
<p>Had he known that it was her love for him and
her despair at losing him that led her to the act it
would have been different.</p>
<p>He said nothing for a moment after Miss Pinckney
had finished. Having already confessed to her
his love for Phyl he was too proud to show his anger
against her now.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was unwise of her,&#8221; he said at last, turning
away to the window and looking out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most,&#8221; replied she, &#8220;but you cannot put old
heads on young shoulders. Well, there, it&#8217;s over
and done with and there&#8217;s no more to be said.
Well, I must go up and change before luncheon.
You are having luncheon here?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have to meet a man at the club.
I only just ran in to see if you were back.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went off and that day Miss Pinckney and Phyl
had luncheon alone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p>Richard Pinckney, like most people, had
the defects of his qualities, but he was different
from others in this: his temper was quick and
blazing when roused, yet on rare occasions it could
hold its heat and smoulder, and keep alive indefinitely.</p>
<p>When in this condition he shewed nothing of his
feelings except towards the person against whom he
was in wrath.</p>
<p>Towards them he exhibited the two main characteristics
of the North Pole&mdash;Distance and Ice.</p>
<p>Phyl felt the frost almost immediately. He
talked to her just the same as of old but his pleasantness
and laughter were gone and he never sought her
eye. She knew at once that it was the business with
Silas that had caused this change, and she would
have been entirely miserable but for the knowledge
of two great facts: she was innocent of any disloyalty
to him, he had broken off his engagement to Frances
Rhett. Instinct told her that he cared for her, Miss
Pinckney had told her the same thing.</p>
<p>Yet day after day passed without bringing the
slightest change in Richard Pinckney.</p>
<p>That gentleman after many debates with himself
had arrived at the determination against will,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
against reason, against Love, and against nature to
have nothing more to do with Phyl.</p>
<p>Old Pepper Pinckney, that volcano of the past
had suffered a fancied insult from his wife; no one
knew of it, no one suspected it till on his death his
will disclosed it by the fact that he had left the
lady&mdash;one dollar. The will being unwitnessed&mdash;that
was the sort of man he was&mdash;did not hold; all
the same, it held an unsuspected part of his character
up for public inspection.</p>
<p>Richard, incapable of such an act, still had Pepper
Pinckney for an ancestor. Ancestors leave us
more than their pictures.</p>
<p>Having come to this momentous decision, he arrived
at another.</p>
<p>One morning at breakfast he announced his intention
of going to New York on business, he would
start on the morrow and be gone a month. The
Beauregards had always been bothering him to go
on a visit and he might as well kill two birds with
one stone.</p>
<p>Miss Pinckney made little resistance to the idea.
She had noticed the coolness between the young
people; knowing how much they cared one for the
other she had little fear as to the end of the matter
and she fancied a change might do good.</p>
<p>But to Phyl it seemed that the end of the world
had come.</p>
<p>All that day she scarcely spoke except to Miss
Pinckney. She was like a person stunned by some
calamity.</p>
<p>Richard Pinckney, notwithstanding the fact that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
he was to leave for New York on the morrow, did
not return to dinner that night. Phyl went upstairs
early but she did not go to her room, she went to
Juliet&#8217;s. Sorrow attracts sorrow. Juliet had always
seemed more than a friend, more than a sister,
even.</p>
<p>There were times when the ungraspable idea came
before her that Juliet was herself. The vision of
the Civil War sometimes came back to her and always
with the hint, like a half veiled threat, that
Richard the man she loved was Rupert the man she
had loved, that following the dark law of duplication
that works alike for types and events, forms
and ideas, her history was to repeat the history of
Juliet.</p>
<p>She had saved Richard from death at the hands
of Silas Grangerson, her love for him had met Fate
face to face and won, but Fate has many reserve
weapons. She is an old warrior, and the conqueror
of cities and kings does not turn from her purpose
because of a momentary defeat.</p>
<p>Phyl shut the door of the room, put the lamp she
was carrying on a table and opened the long windows
giving upon the piazza. The night was absolutely
still, not a breath of wind stirred the foliage
of the garden and the faint sounds of the city rose
through the warm night. The waning moon would
not rise yet for an hour and the stars had the sky
to themselves.</p>
<p>She turned from the window and going to the
little bureau by the door opened the secret drawer
and took out the packet of letters. Then drawing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
an armchair close to the table and the lamp she
sat down, undid the ribbon and began to read the
letters.</p>
<p>She felt just as though Juliet were talking to her,
telling her of her troubles. She read on placing
each letter on the table in turn, one upon the other.</p>
<p>The chimes of St. Michael&#8217;s came through the
open window but they were unheeded.</p>
<p>When she had read through all the letters she
picked out one. The one containing the passionate
declaration of Juliet&#8217;s love.</p>
<p>She re-read it and then placed it on the table on
top of the others.</p>
<p>If she could speak of Richard like that!</p>
<p>But she could do nothing and say nothing. It is
one of the curses of womanhood that a woman may
not say to a man &#8220;I love you,&#8221; that the initiative is
taken out of her hands.</p>
<p>Phyl was a creature of impulse and it was now
for the first time in her life that she recognised this
fatal barrier on the woman&#8217;s side. With the recognition
came the impulse to over jump it.</p>
<p>He cared for her, she knew, or had cared for her.
She felt that it only required a movement on her
side, a touch, a word to destroy the ice that had
formed between them. If he were to go away he
might never return, nay, he would never return, of
that she felt sure.</p>
<p>And he would go away unless she spoke. She
must speak, not to-morrow in the cold light of day
when things were impossible, but now, at once, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
would say to him simply the truth, &#8220;I love you.&#8221;
If he were to turn away or repulse her it would kill
her. No matter, life was absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>She rose from her chair and was just on the point
of turning to the door when something checked her.</p>
<p>It was the clock of St. Michael&#8217;s striking one.</p>
<p>One o&#8217;clock. The whole household would be in
bed. He would have retired to his room long ago&mdash;and
to-morrow it would be too late.</p>
<p>She could never say that to him to-morrow; even
now the impulse was dying away, the strength that
would have broken convention and disregarded all
things was fading in her. She had been dreaming
whilst she ought to have been doing, and the hour
had passed and would never return.</p>
<p>She sat down again in the chair.</p>
<p>The moon in the cloudless sky outside cast a patch
of silver on the floor, then it shewed a silver rim
gradually increasing against the sky as it pushed its
way through the night to peep in at Phyl. Leaning
back in the chair limp and exhausted, with closed
eyes, one might have fancied her dead or in a trance
and the moon as if to make sure pushed on, framing
itself now fully in the window space.</p>
<p>The clock of St. Michael&#8217;s struck two, then it
chimed the quarter after and almost on the chime
Phyl sat up. It was as though she had suddenly
come to a resolve. She clasped her hands together
for a moment, then she rose, gathered up the letters
and put them away, all except one which she
held in her hand as though to give her courage for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
what she was about to do. She carefully extinguished
the lamp and then led by the moonlight came
out on to the piazza.</p>
<p>Charleston was asleep under the moon; the air
was filled with the scent of night jessamine and the
faint fragrance of foliage, and scarcely a sound came
from all the sleeping city beyond the garden walls
and the sea beyond the city.</p>
<p>As she stood with one hand on the piazza rail,
suddenly, far away but shrill, came the crowing of
a cock.</p>
<p>She shivered as though the sound were a menace,
then rigidly gliding like a ghost escaped from the
grave and warned by the cockcrow that the hour of
return was near, she came along the piazza, mounted
the stair to the next floor and came along the upper
piazza to the window of Richard Pinckney&#8217;s bedroom.</p>
<p>The window was open and, pushing the curtains
aside, she went in.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p>Richard Pinckney went to his room at
eleven that night. He rarely retired before
twelve, but to-night he had packing to do as Jabez,
his man, was away and he knew better than to trust
Seth.</p>
<p>He packed his portmanteau and left it lying open
in case he had forgotten anything that could be put
in at the last moment. Then he packed a kit-bag
and, having smoked a cigarette, went to bed.</p>
<p>But he did not fall asleep. As a rule he slept at
once on lying down, but to-night he lay awake.</p>
<p>He was miserable; going away was death to him,
but he was going.</p>
<p>First of all, because he had said that he was
going. Secondly, because he wanted to hit and hurt
Phyl whom he loved, thirdly, because he wanted to
torture himself, fourthly, because he loathed and
hated Silas Grangerson, fifthly, because in his heart
of hearts he knew what he was doing was wrong.</p>
<p>You never know really what is in a man till he
is pinched by Love. Love may stun him with a
blow or run a dagger into him without bringing his
worst qualities to light whilst a sly pinch will raise
devils&mdash;all the miserable devils that march under
the leadership of Pique.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>If he had not loved Phyl the fact of her going
off with Silas for a drive after what had occurred
on the night before would have hurt him. Loving
her it had maddened him.</p>
<p>He was not angry with her now, so he told himself&mdash;just
disgusted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he could not sleep. The faithful St.
Michael&#8217;s kept him well aware of this fact. He lit
a candle and tried to read, smoked a cigarette and
then, blowing the candle out, tried to sleep. But insomnia
had him fairly in her grip; to-night there was
no escape from her and he lay whilst the moon,
creeping through the sky, cast her light on the piazza
outside.</p>
<p>St. Michael&#8217;s chimed the quarter after two and
sleep, long absent, was coming at last when, suddenly,
the sound of a light footstep on the piazza
drove her leagues away.</p>
<p>Then outside in the full moonlight he saw a figure.
It was Phyl, fully dressed, standing with outstretched
hands. Her eyes wide open, fixed, and
sightless, told their tale. She was asleep.</p>
<p>She moved the curtains aside and entered the
room, darkening the window space, passed across
the room without the least sound, reached the bed,
and knelt down beside it. Her hand was feeling
for him, it touched his neck, he raised his head
slightly from the pillow and her arm, gliding like a
snake round his neck drew his head towards her;
then her lips, blindly seeking, found his and clung
to them for a moment.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more ghostly, more terrible, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
yet more lovely than that kiss, the kiss of a spirit,
the embrace of a soul rising from the profound
abysm of sleep to find its mate.</p>
<p>Then her lips withdrew and he lay praying to
God, as few men have ever prayed, that she might
not wake.</p>
<p>He felt the arm withdrawing from around his
neck, she rose, wavered for a moment, and then
passed away towards the window. The lace curtains
parted as though drawn aside, closed again,
and she was gone.</p>
<p>He left his bed and came out on the piazza.
Craning over he caught a glimpse of her returning
along the lower piazza and vanishing.</p>
<p>Coming back to his room he saw something lying
on the floor by his bed; it was a letter; he struck a
match, lit the candle and picked the letter up. It
was just a folded piece of paper, it had been sealed,
but the seal was broken, and sitting down on the
side of the bed he spread it open, but his hands
were shaking so that he had to rest it on his knee.</p>
<p>It was not from Phyl. That letter had been written
many, many years ago, the ink was faded and
the handwriting of another day.</p>
<p>He read it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to-night. I have to go to the Calhouns.
It is just as well for I have a dread of people suspecting
if we meet too often....</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I feel as if I were deceiving him and
everybody. I am, and I don&#8217;t care. Oh, my darling!
my darling! my darling! If the whole world
were against you I would love you all the more. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
will love you all my life, and I will love you when
I am dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the letter of Juliet to her lover.</p>
<p>He turned it over and looked at the seal with the
little dove upon it. He knew of Juliet&#8217;s letters, and
he knew at once that this was one of them, and he
guessed vaguely that she had been reading it when
sleep overtook her and that it had formed part of
the inspiration that led her to him. But the whole
truth he would never know.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>A blazing red Cardinal was singing in the magnolia
tree by the gate, butterflies were chasing one
another above the flowers; it was seven o&#8217;clock and
the blue, lazy, lovely morning was unfolding like a
flower to the sea wind.</p>
<p>Richard Pinckney was standing in the piazza before
his bedroom window looking down into the
garden.</p>
<p>To him suddenly appeared Seth.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you please, sah,&#8221; said Seth, &#8220;Rachel tole me
tell yo&#8217; de train for N&#8217;York&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn New York,&#8221; said Pinckney. &#8220;Get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth vanished, grinning, and he returned to his
contemplation of the garden.</p>
<p>She must never know.&mdash;In the years to come,
perhaps, he might tell her&mdash; In the years to
come&mdash;</p>
<p>He was turning away when a step on the piazza
below made him come to the rail again and lean
over. It was Phyl. She vanished and then reappeared
again, leaving the lower piazza and coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
right out into the garden. He waited till the sun
had caught her in both hands, holding her against
the background of the cherokee roses, then he called
to her:</p>
<p>&#8220;Phyl!&#8221;</p>
<p>She started, turned, and looked up.</p>
